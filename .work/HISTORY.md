## 2026-09-14 — v0.1.5 published with Chocolatey submission [0789] [0791] [0804]

Root v0.1.5 names fa9d3c15. CI 34844356688 passes just verify. A fresh
development database passes all four signal cases and the v0.1.4 client
compatibility round-trip under -race: compat.lab stream 5, consumer group 6,
five distinct payloads consumed, then the stream destroyed. Library and
schema are unchanged from v0.1.4; both scopes remain v1.

[Release run 34844608693](https://github.com/allegedlyreliable/sqlstreams/actions/runs/34844608693)
passes, publishing six archives, checksums, and the Homebrew cask. All six
downloaded archives match checksums.txt. The Mac arm64 archive and Homebrew
upgrade from 0.1.4 report version 0.1.5. Windows Chocolatey installation,
checksum, version output, uninstall, and submission pass. Package metadata
reports Submitted/Pending, IsApproved=false; public-feed verification waits
for approval. OTel v0.1.5 is published at b529043e after CI 34846835381
passed. CLI root/OTel pins now use v0.1.5 and pass standalone build and race
tests; CLI publication awaits the maintainer's push. Every release requires
matching module versions, even without code changes [0805].

Post-release preparation: examples, .tests, .bench, and .tools pin v0.1.5
and pass standalone builds and race tests, including Docker integration tests.
The external Go quickstart pins v0.1.5 and its fresh-DB walkthrough passes
after correcting the Postgres 18 volume mount to /var/lib/postgresql;
producer returns message 1, consumer receives user-123 and exits on SIGTERM.
Its README link now uses sqlstreams.io. The doc-site sample carries the same
volume correction. Installation links, migration evidence, and docs version
metadata are published in 5a16a596; quickstart changes are pushed in 090039d.
CI 34845512788 passes. Site static checks, all 132 unit
tests, build, and 45 browser cases pass; browser tests use temporary port 4322
because the default port is occupied.

Docs deployed live as 8beb3a02 and frozen as 4d93ead2 at
https://v0-1-5.sqlstreams.pages.dev. Both origins pass homepage, quickstart,
migration-page, and versions.json checks for v0.1.5; manifests permit CORS
and the frozen site carries noindex. The v0-1-4 snapshot remains unchanged.

## 2026-09-14 — v0.1.4 archives and Go modules published [0786] [0789] [0791]

Root v0.1.4 names 40c98b58. The checkpoint below passed just verify,
all four fresh-database signal cases, and the v0.1.2 compatibility round-trip
under the race detector. GoReleaser published all six archives and checksums
in [run 34839844935](https://github.com/allegedlyreliable/sqlstreams/actions/runs/34839844935).
All six downloaded archives match checksums.txt. The Mac arm64 archive and
Homebrew upgrade from 0.1.1 both report sqlstreams version 0.1.4.

otel/v0.1.4 names c03e8b4d; cmd/sqlstreams/v0.1.4 names fd7a631e. Both
modules passed standalone build, vet, and race tests. Outside the workspace,
CLI go install reports sqlstreams version v0.1.4 and a separate OTel consumer
resolves and validates its default configuration.

Windows Chocolatey installation, checksum, version output, and uninstall
passed; submission returned HTTP 403. The workflow is therefore red despite
successful archive and Homebrew publication. Public-feed installation remains
unverified. The earlier v0.1.3 attempt could not upload archives because its
manually published GitHub release was immutable.

The v0.1.4 docs and permanent alias v0-1-4 are deployed. Site formatting,
lint, type/prose checks, all 132 unit tests, and the build pass. Browser
verification covers all 45 cases across Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit:
24 flow cases passed in the full run; all 21 profile cases passed after
updating stale clock advances from 4s/110s to the existing 5s/50s behavior.
The runtime timings are unchanged. Browser checks used a temporary port-4322
configuration because existing local servers prevented the recipe's preview
startup. Existing Svelte warnings and build bundling/indexing warnings remain.

Verification fixes include formatting, the existing 8px spacing token,
one prose punctuation fix, and sandbox SQL comment synchronization; the
SQL drift test is unchanged.

Approved deployment: live 9e490c70 and frozen 7d691654 at
https://v0-1-4.sqlstreams.pages.dev. The freeze reused all 1,517 uploaded
files. Both origins return 200 for the homepage, quickstart, migration guide,
and versions.json; version metadata is v0.1.4, registry CORS is enabled,
and frozen HTML carries noindex. Live Cloudflare email obfuscation rewrites
the quickstart's sqlstreams@v0.1.4 as an email-protection link; frozen content
is correct. The user confirmed normal browser display; the HTML rewrite
does not establish a user-facing defect, so no zone-setting change is needed.

## 2026-09-14 — Release checkpoint verified (unpublished) [0789]

Source 4da16369 passes just verify, including Docker integration tests.
The compatibility driver is pinned to published v0.1.2, tidied, and passes
standalone build and vet with GOWORK=off. On a fresh development database,
just system-register and all four just signal-e2e cases pass. The killed
producer leaves no transaction, lock, or message; SIGTERM drains the producer
and idle consumer; a second SIGTERM forces the hung handler to exit 143.

GOFLAGS=-race just compat-lab round-trip passes against current-build tables:
compat.lab (stream 5), compat.lab.group (consumer group 6), payloads and
message ids 1–5. The published client consumed all five distinct payloads
and destroyed the stream. Both scopes remain schema v1 with empty migration
registries; no upgrade DDL was needed. The migration table records this
unpublished checkpoint separately from earlier release results.

Release changes since v0.1.2 include permanent claim errors reaching the
consumer, exception-consumer retry fixes, explicit datastore retry semantics,
named consumer-not-found errors, clearer alert evidence diagnostics, and
documentation updates. RELEASE.md now holds the basic release checklist.
No release tag or deployment was made.

## 2026-09-13 — Each board owns its page [0802]

Seven dedicated Astro pages replace the dynamic board route. Board definitions
live beside their pages; Troubleshooting owns its intro and code sections,
and Decision records owns its column labels. Shared navigation, membership,
row rendering, and unread tracking remain. The shared intro field and section
dispatcher are removed.

Verified with the site build, Astro checks, targeted lint, 40 thread/code
tests, and before/after comparisons of every existing board thread and its
order. Browser checks covered all seven boards, thread and adjacent links,
unread indicators, jump targets, home board counts, and mobile layouts.
The three index redirects and all individual thread URLs still resolve.

## 2026-09-13 — Reference uses one board index [0801]

Removed the duplicate API reference index and its board entry. `/reference/`
redirects to the Reference board; individual lookup pages and the API shape
explanation retain their content. Verified with targeted formatting and lint,
the site build, and checks of the generated redirect and board links.

## 2026-09-13 — Troubleshooting uses one board index [0800]

The Troubleshooting board groups all code pages into errors, log events,
metrics, and alerts, with recovery, level, kind, or severity alongside each.
Code lookup guidance moves onto the board; the stale Error codes index
redirects there. Metadata uses the declaration export and code-page log
levels. Verified with the site build, Astro checks, targeted lint, 11 code
metadata tests, and browser checks covering all 109 codes, redirects,
navigation, decision-board metadata, and mobile width.

## 2026-09-13 — Decision records use one board index [0799]

The Decision records board shows status and decision dates, newest record
first. The duplicate Regrets page redirects there; its index components are
removed. Read tracking still uses Git update dates. Long record titles wrap
on mobile. Verified with the site build, Astro type checks, targeted lint,
and browser checks for redirect, ordering, navigation, and mobile width.

## 2026-09-13 — Runtime alerts distinguish invalid evidence from unavailable evidence [0797]

AlertEvaluationSnapshot carries EvidenceInvalid and preserves the specific
semantic rejection reason through history evaluation. The shared Record path
logs unavailable evidence at DEBUG and invalid evidence as SQL0109 at WARN,
with alert and owner identity. Collector progress no longer warns separately
for missing manager coverage. Recorded alerts, failed-stream counts,
registration DEBUG, read/decode errors, and collector activation rules retain
their existing behavior. The alerts reference and SQL0109 page document the
classification and suppression limits; the client exposes the new event.

Verified by the root build, targeted race tests across the alert packages,
producer, consumer, and client, and targeted convention checks for the API
closure and diagnostic declarations. New unit tests cover all four evaluators,
reason propagation, stale-data precedence, pending-span breaks, retained decode
errors, and Record's log levels and identities without persistence. Existing
Go tests were unchanged. The site build and targeted Prettier, remark, and Vale
checks passed; the site still emits sandbox/PGlite bundling warnings.

## 2026-09-13 — Threads declare a slop level [0798]

Every doc-site thread through the thread route now carries a `slop`
frontmatter level, and ThreadLayout renders a slop-notice box at the top
of the post: a thread-aside variant with a tinted chip, a three-block
pixel meter, and fixed per-level copy. Forty-five threads start at
`high`; the quickstart is `none` (hand-checked, no box); the diagnostics
reference and the SQL-code threads carry no field. Verified by Prettier,
ESLint, stylelint, astro check, svelte-check, remark, Vitest, and the site
build; the build output was inspected for the notice's presence and
absence per page. Vale was not installed locally and did not run. One
Vitest failure (the embedded-SQL drift check against the consume
datastore) and one stylelint error (board-banner.css) pre-date this
change.

## 2026-09-13 — Registration keeps insufficient alert evidence at DEBUG [0796]

Producer and consumer registration now log insufficient evidence at DEBUG,
with the evaluator's reason in detail. Evaluation errors and alert findings
remain WARN. The diagnostic page explains absent startup measurements and
the fresh evidence required for worker-liveness findings. Runtime levels are
unchanged; the accepted cause-based policy and review findings are in Next.
Both regression tests failed against the original warning and passed after
the fix. Verified by the root build, targeted producer/consumer race tests,
go fmt, site build, targeted Prettier/remark/Vale checks, and git diff --check.
The site build reported sandbox/PGlite bundling warnings.

## 2026-09-13 — Documentation code blocks support copying [0795]

Expressive Code renders Markdown and MDX fences with copy controls during
site builds. The integration keeps the board palettes, fonts, plain frames,
and comments in copied examples. It replaces the custom code-block island;
link and diagnostic-query copy buttons keep their existing component.
Verified by the site build, Astro type checks, targeted formatting and lint,
and Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit checks for copying, feedback, theme
switching, mobile rendering, and navigation.

## 2026-09-12 — Release maintenance and private security reporting documented [0794]

The upgrade guide and contributor rules maintain the latest stable release
only and retain deprecated public APIs through at least one subsequent minor
release, with announced replacements and explicit urgent security exceptions.
SECURITY.md directs private reports to GitHub and sets a seven-day
acknowledgment target. GitHub's reporting setting was verified already enabled;
README and CONTRIBUTING link the policy. Further PostgreSQL verification stays
in Next, and evidence for the next real schema migration is recorded in Later.
Verified by the site build, targeted Prettier, remark, and Vale checks, and
git diff --check. Documentation remains in the working tree pending release.

## 2026-09-12 — Contributor testing instructions and diagnostic codes corrected

DEVELOPING.md now directs database tests through just test-integration,
explains automatic Postgres containers and the optional existing-server
override, and uses the current signal-e2e recipe for shutdown checks.
The bug issue template requests SQLnnnn diagnostic codes. Checked against
the integration test setup, recipe definitions, and error declarations.

## 2026-09-12 — The message consumer's permit pool is the weighted semaphore

`WorkerPoolLimiter` appended each permit's owner to a slice under a mutex
and deleted it on release, and nothing read the slice; its `PoolLimiter`
interface had one implementation and no seam. The type and its owner
parameter are deleted and the runner holds `semaphore.Weighted` directly,
sized by the config's already-validated `MessageConcurrency`. The queue's
broadcast-signal idea left the code for the ROADMAP parking lot.
Verified by build, vet, `go test -race` on the touched packages, and the
conventions checks.

## 2026-09-12 — Ambiguous-outcome retries are opted into per datastore write [0793]

`DatastoreRetry.Wrap` retried every transient SQLSTATE, including the
ones under which a statement may have committed before the connection
died, and a comment claimed every call site had been audited. The
wrapper is now two verbs with no bare default: `WrapNonIdempotent`
retries only what the server rolled back or never received,
`WrapIdempotent` also retries a lost connection after a statement
shipped and is the verb for reads and guarded writes. Ten unguarded
writes use `WrapNonIdempotent`, named in the record with what their
callers do with the returned error; the other 81 use `WrapIdempotent`
unchanged in behavior. A ledger-plus-conventions-test
built first was rejected as a presence check and removed. Verified by
build, vet, `go test -race` on the touched packages, the closed-set
wrapper tests, and the conventions checks.

## 2026-09-12 — Unit tests pin the consumer's in-process range bookkeeping

`pkg/consume` carried no unit test; the integration suite pinned the SQL
promises and nothing pinned the in-memory ones beside them. Nine tests now
sit beside `range_state.go` and `claim_buffer.go`: the contiguous partial
commit stops at the lowest unresolved row, the snapshot goes to exactly
one caller without a premature call spending it, success outcomes are
collected only under DeliveryLogModeAll, an ordered key queues one chain
head and defers the rest behind a failure, removeAll fences late
resolvers, neverDispatched flips on the first dequeue, and markStale
records once. One synctest test beside `queue.go` pins WaitForRoom's
debounce and dequeue wake. Sabotaged (the contiguous walk's break turned
into continue) before trusted. Verified by vet, `go test -race`, and the
conventions checks.

## 2026-09-12 — Consumer claim loops end on a permanent fault, warn on a transient one [0792]

The message consumer's prefetch loop swallowed every non-cancel claim
error as a blip and polled forever, so a deleted cursor row or revoked
grant left a consumer looking alive with a growing backlog; the exception
consumer's claim loop ended `Consume` on any error, a spent transient
curve included. Both now classify the error the way `RetryDatastore.Wrap`
does: a transient cause logs the new Warn event SQL0108 "could not claim
messages" and waits one poll rate; a permanent cause returns and ends
`Consume` with it. Docs page and client alias added; codes export
regenerated. Verified by build, vet, `go test -race` on pkg/consume and
pkg/common, and the conventions checks.

## 2026-09-12 — Release pipeline task closed [0785] [0786] [0787] [0788] [0789] [0791]

The original release-pipeline, dependency-scanning, and package-manager
roadmap item is complete: CLI releases, stable Go module publication,
Dependabot coverage/security remediation, Homebrew installation, release
compatibility checks, and Chocolatey installation/submission are proved
in the entries below. Its active TODO and Now roadmap item are removed.
Chocolatey moderator approval and subsequent public-feed validation move
to a focused Next item, including the final installation documentation.
Optional signing and additional package managers remain Later work.

## 2026-09-12 — Chocolatey installation and submission verified [0791]

[v0.1.2](https://github.com/allegedlyreliable/sqlstreams/releases/tag/v0.1.2)
names 3fbfbe3e6cc5bee8698af217bd401829aa9a5755. Main-push
[CI 34724910513](https://github.com/allegedlyreliable/sqlstreams/actions/runs/34724910513)
and Windows [release run 34724932748](https://github.com/allegedlyreliable/sqlstreams/actions/runs/34724932748)
both pass. GoReleaser 2.18.1 publishes all six archives and checksums and
updates the Homebrew cask in tap commit 98c18c22 to version 0.1.2.

The Windows x64 runner installs sqlstreams.0.1.2.nupkg from .dist. Its
generated installer downloads the real GitHub Windows amd64 archive and
checks its SHA-256, 50b5bc5496da127e224f2558b677bf6626a6993b222e6ba871cb8a1736764e91.
Chocolatey creates the CLI shim; it prints sqlstreams version 0.1.2.
Installation and uninstall both succeed, then choco push submits that
same package to https://push.chocolatey.org/ at 23:20:52 UTC.
This proves packaging, download/checksum, shim/version, uninstall, and
account/API-key submission without the discarded snapshot-server approach.

Chocolatey's public package metadata reports version 0.1.2,
PackageStatus=Submitted, PackageSubmittedStatus=Pending, IsApproved=false.
Moderation and subsequent public-feed installation are a Next roadmap item; the
README does not yet advertise Chocolatey as available. Archive links now
point to v0.1.2; the separately published OTel and CLI Go modules remain
v0.1.1 with their existing stable pins.

Application/module source is unchanged from the verified CLI publication
9b575408. The fresh-DB signal and RC compatibility results cited in the
v0.1.0 checkpoint remain the source/schema evidence; no migration steps or
application changes landed in this packaging release. The migration table
records v0.1.2 as retaining that checkpoint. No site deployment was performed.

## 2026-09-12 — Stable CLI Go module publication verified [0786]

[cmd/sqlstreams/v0.1.1](https://github.com/allegedlyreliable/sqlstreams/tree/cmd/sqlstreams/v0.1.1/cmd/sqlstreams)
names 9b5754083f25c7aac487d053ed43168e054585c4. It requires published root
v0.1.1 (e4a768ba) and OTel v0.1.1 (fe29a31f), with no replacements.
Go download metadata confirms the CLI tag, commit, and checksum
h1:iprS/LlC2/7BwcQeFhW7qwT8+GoiCyY8j/78xWxqbFA=.

GOWORK=off go install of the versioned CLI succeeds from /private/tmp into
an isolated GOBIN; Go selects toolchain 1.27.1. The installed binary prints
sqlstreams version v0.1.1 and --help succeeds. Build metadata identifies
CLI, root, and OTel v0.1.1 with no replacements. Before tagging, the CLI
passed standalone tidy -diff, build, vet, and race tests against these
published dependencies. The dependency-graph run
[34723190128](https://github.com/allegedlyreliable/sqlstreams/actions/runs/34723190128)
passes on the publication commit.

All six active nested modules now pin root v0.1.1; CLI also pins stable
OTel. The compatibility driver intentionally retains the tested RC.
Both READMEs publish the verified stable Go installation command alongside
Homebrew and GitHub archives, and the quickstart pins the stable root.
This completes stable Go module publication. Chocolatey remains in TODO;
no GitHub release archives, Homebrew cask, or site deployment changed here.

## 2026-09-12 — Stable OTel Go module publication verified [0786] [0787]

[otel/v0.1.1](https://github.com/allegedlyreliable/sqlstreams/tree/otel/v0.1.1/otel)
names fe29a31f90c073bec7de88c7570fcd4cbf314de4 and requires the published
root v0.1.1. Go download metadata confirms the tag, subdirectory, commit,
and module checksum h1:80da6X8isHxGqoF1YzSH874ruDPbi2FZaYwPPowRNWA=.

A fresh module outside the repository resolves published OTel and root
v0.1.1 with GOWORK=off and no replacements. Its executable imports both
modules, validates exporter defaults, and prints schema=sqlstreams and
timeout=5s. Before publication, OTel and the five other active nested
modules passed standalone tidy -diff, build, vet, and race checks against
root v0.1.1, including the Docker integration suite. Commit fe29a31f
publishes those root pins and the refreshed installation/release docs.
The compatibility driver intentionally retains its tested v0.1.0-rc.1 pin.

CLI stable publication remains pending: its next commit must require the
now-published OTel v0.1.1 before cmd/sqlstreams/v0.1.1 is tagged. No root
tag, GitHub release asset, or Homebrew cask was changed by the OTel tag.

## 2026-09-12 — Stable CLI and Homebrew installation verified [0788] [0789]

[v0.1.1](https://github.com/allegedlyreliable/sqlstreams/releases/tag/v0.1.1)
names e4a768ba65d9a4dd211cdfe4939d798cf637f00e. Windows
[release run 34722343301](https://github.com/allegedlyreliable/sqlstreams/actions/runs/34722343301)
passes, publishes six archives and checksums, and writes the stable cask to
allegedlyreliable/homebrew-tap in
[commit 44e16a1d](https://github.com/allegedlyreliable/homebrew-tap/commit/44e16a1d8707821673e4a372ac709b89ce60389a).
All four cask hashes match their corresponding release asset digests.

The existing local Homebrew installation is verified on macOS arm64.
Its receipt names allegedlyreliable/tap, tap commit 44e16a1d, and version
0.1.1. /opt/homebrew/bin/sqlstreams links to that Caskroom binary and
--version prints sqlstreams version 0.1.1. Binary metadata identifies
release commit e4a768ba with vcs.modified=false. This proves tap write
access, cask publication, and an installed native binary.

The earlier v0.1.0 run published its GitHub assets before failing on the
Homebrew token template. The fix uses the restricted evaluator's direct
.Env.HOMEBREW_TAP_TOKEN reference; the published v0.1.0 tag is preserved.
Library, CLI, and OTel source are unchanged from checkpoint b5bcded6, whose
fresh-DB signal suite, full just verify, and prior-RC compatibility
round-trip passed (entry below). Those suites were not repeated for the
credential-template correction. The migration table now lists both stable
releases. Chocolatey remains skipped, and stable nested Go module tags
remain unpublished. No site deployment was performed.

## 2026-09-12 — v0.1.0 release checkpoint verified (release unpublished) [0789]

Source 65efd3a1964cddee5ef3b4a915f5e12c0651b442 passes the fresh-database
release checkpoint. The development Postgres 17 database was deleted and
recreated with just database-delete and Docker Compose, then initialized
by the current build's just system-register. just signal-e2e passes all
four scenarios: SIGKILL leaves no producer transaction, lock, or message;
SIGTERM commits both reported producer messages and exits 0; an idle
consumer exits 0 in 35 ms; a hung handler exits 143 on the second SIGTERM
in 504 ms. The complete just verify suite also passes, including race
tests, Docker integration tests, nested modules, and conventions checks.

.tools/compat now uses the supported client API from the actual published
root v0.1.0-rc.1 (9772deee), with GOWORK=off and no replacement. Binary
build metadata confirms that dependency and checksum
h1:/6dQQQxvKhzsgcQbjEi2fyWI3OcwgPk9F9PInOeC30M=.
The current producer example creates compat.lab with -count=0 first;
the driver checks both migration versions before registering anything.

GOFLAGS=-race just compat-lab round-trip passes against compat.lab
(stream id 5), system/stream schema 1/1: message ids 1–5 carry five distinct
numbered payloads, compat.lab.group (id 6) consumes all five, and stream
destruction is verified. The missing-stream control fails with SQL0005;
the deliberately wrong refused verdict fails because registration succeeds.
The isolated compatibility module also passes tidy, fmt, build, and vet.

The registry-declared verdict is round-trip: both registries have no
migration steps, and source under pkg/ and client/ is identical to
v0.1.0-rc.1.
The schema export remains unchanged. The migration guide records the
verified pair and labels v0.1.0 as an unreleased proposal. This proves the
unchanged v1 baseline; no upgrade DDL or general pre-v1 compatibility promise
is claimed. No stable tag, package-manager publication, or site deployment
was performed at this checkpoint.

## 2026-09-12 — Dependency remediation and graph refresh verified [0787]

Published commit 06012764 applies the reviewed Go group plus the
moby/go-archive v0.3.0 fix, Astro 7.3.2, Sharp 0.35.4, and npm transitive
fixes. All 21 previously observed security alerts are closed; a fresh API
read reports zero open alerts. Dependabot PRs #7–10 are closed.
[CI 34720013444](https://github.com/allegedlyreliable/sqlstreams/actions/runs/34720013444)
and [graph refresh 34720015382](https://github.com/allegedlyreliable/sqlstreams/actions/runs/34720015382)
both succeed, superseding the earlier failed .tools snapshot submission.
Routine version-update PRs #1 (Actions) and #11 (website) remain open.

The dependency change passed just verify and standalone module checks.
Website build, type checks, ESLint, remark, Vale, edited-manifest
formatting, and Wrangler startup passed; npm audit reported zero
vulnerabilities. Existing failures reproduced against the original npm
lockfile: five formatting failures, board-banner.css:26's token violation,
the SQL-comment drift assertion (131/132 unit tests pass), and 12
member-profile animation failures (33/45 browser flows pass). No tests or
unrelated source were changed. Evidence remains in
/private/tmp/sqlstreams-dependency-*.log and
/private/tmp/sqlstreams-site-before-*.log. No site deployment was performed.

## 2026-09-12 — Seven-module Dependabot version updates verified [0787]

Pushed commit 5e6ae93c9f63b3c3f010e6b587bc54b9bf033d09 pins the four dev
modules to published root v0.1.0-rc.1 and configures one Go group across
root, CLI, OTel, .bench, .tests, .tools, and examples. Monthly scheduling
and the seven-day cooldown remain; .tools/compat stays excluded.

[Go update run 34718872371](https://github.com/allegedlyreliable/sqlstreams/actions/runs/34718872371)
completes successfully at 21:10 UTC, processes all seven directories, and
reports no dependency-resolution errors. It opens exactly one grouped
[PR #10](https://github.com/allegedlyreliable/sqlstreams/pull/10) and closes
the previous root-only #4. The PR changes go.mod/go.sum in all seven
modules; its generated title counts six directories. The same push's
[npm check](https://github.com/allegedlyreliable/sqlstreams/actions/runs/34718872604)
and [Actions check](https://github.com/allegedlyreliable/sqlstreams/actions/runs/34718872733)
also succeed at 21:09 UTC. Main-push
[CI 34718870119](https://github.com/allegedlyreliable/sqlstreams/actions/runs/34718870119)
passes just verify on the published configuration. These results prove
update generation, not the compatibility of the proposed dependency upgrades.

Before publication, all four dev modules passed standalone tidy/fmt/build/vet;
.bench and .tools passed race tests. The complete .tests integration suite
passed against disposable Docker Postgres with GOWORK=off and -race -count=1;
no tests changed. Resolution checks select the published root standalone
and local source through go.work.

Alerts and automatic security updates are enabled; grouped security updates
are user-confirmed enabled. Scanning exposes 21 open alerts: 20 website
alerts (one critical) and one high moby/go-archive alert in .tests/go.mod,
fixed in 0.3.0. The separate
[graph update](https://github.com/allegedlyreliable/sqlstreams/actions/runs/34718871790)
parsed all four dev manifests but received HTTP 500 storing .tools' snapshot.
GitHub refuses a rerun, and .tools' graph still lacks its new root requirement.
Graph refresh, security review, and package-manager publication remain in TODO.

## 2026-09-12 — OTel and CLI Go module publication verified [0786]

[otel/v0.1.0-rc.1](https://github.com/allegedlyreliable/sqlstreams/tree/otel/v0.1.0-rc.1/otel)
names c99bd5e8ab38c82311e36695e596f30dd3a66356 and requires root
v0.1.0-rc.1. The CLI tag
[cmd/sqlstreams/v0.1.0-rc.1](https://github.com/allegedlyreliable/sqlstreams/tree/cmd/sqlstreams/v0.1.0-rc.1/cmd/sqlstreams)
names 06dc9b6f1e86bab71e52f190ffaf39a954ce9daf and requires both published
root and OTel v0.1.0-rc.1. The root tag remains at 9772deee.

Both modules passed tidy/fmt/build/vet/race tests with GOWORK=off against
downloaded dependencies. A fresh consumer outside the repository builds
and runs against published OTel/root without replacements; exporter config
resolves schema=sqlstreams and timeout=5s. Versioned CLI go install succeeds
outside the workspace into a temporary GOBIN. The installed binary's
--version prints sqlstreams version v0.1.0-rc.1, and --help succeeds. Build
metadata confirms CLI, root, and OTel v0.1.0-rc.1 with no replacements;
Go download metadata confirms the CLI tag's commit.

The empty CLI version default delegates to Fang's installed-module build
info; GoReleaser still injects 0.1.0-rc.1 into release archives. READMEs now
show the verified versioned CLI installation command. Homebrew/Chocolatey
publication and the remaining dependency-update configuration stay in TODO.

## 2026-09-12 — First CLI prerelease distribution verified [0785]

[v0.1.0-rc.1](https://github.com/allegedlyreliable/sqlstreams/releases/tag/v0.1.0-rc.1)
tags 9772deee2dd6a49bf343e24b409cd86461b01dba. Main-push CI
[34716240955](https://github.com/allegedlyreliable/sqlstreams/actions/runs/34716240955)
passes just verify, including Docker integration tests. Windows release run
[34716684337](https://github.com/allegedlyreliable/sqlstreams/actions/runs/34716684337)
passes with empty package-manager secrets: Chocolatey is skipped and
Homebrew upload is skipped. Six archives and checksums.txt are published.

All six manifest hashes match GitHub's asset digests. The downloaded macOS
arm64 archive SHA-256 is
72d27022be1c96df96760c101aba74eca9e5131a304c974f339610b30451de10.
Its extracted binary prints sqlstreams version 0.1.0-rc.1 and embeds the
canonical CLI module, the tagged commit, and vcs.modified=false. The root
module downloads at that version with GOWORK=off and a fresh module cache.

Dependabot's graph now includes parseable root, CLI, and OTel manifests
with dependency entries; alerts and automatic security updates are enabled.
Grouped-security settings remain unverified. Nested-module publication and
Homebrew/Chocolatey installation remain in flight. Fresh-DB signal e2e and
compatibility were not run for this CLI distribution verification; no
cross-release compatibility verdict is claimed.

## 2026-09-12 — Idle-fleet fix: the claimant backs off, the losing claim takes no lock, the group manager keeps to its stream, heartbeats jitter [0780] [0781] [0783]

Three changes and one finding, measured with the idle-fleet bench on the
same 8-core Postgres 18.4 as the 2026-09-12 cells. The group manager's
provisioner list stops at its stream: the consumer group janitor,
schedule producer, and metrics collector are the system manager's rows
now, and a `DisableManager` consumer keeps alive its consumers, its
cursor advancer, and its stream's janitor and vacuum. A losing claim reads
`target_instances` and the live count without a lock and declines before
`Begin`. Rung 2 was reshaped: live instances keep their poll rate; the
manager's pool remembers a declined claim per row and backs it off along
`ManagerConfig.ClaimRetry` (1 s to 30 s). The re-run then exposed a
heartbeat herd -- every instance claimed in the same minute renewed in
the same instant every 15 s -- so the instance runner's heartbeat is a
re-jittered timer like every other pacing loop.

| rows x replicas | statements/s | statement time | Postgres cores |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 990 x 1 | 9,125 -> 2,497 | 0.26 -> 0.25 cores | 0.62 -> 0.66 |
| 990 x 3 | 24,153 -> 5,668 | 6.2 (92% in the claim's row lock) -> 1.9 cores | 1.65 -> 1.42 |
| 9,630 x 1 | 7,356 -> 5,585 | 8.2 -> 1.9 cores | 7.4 -> 8.0, not registered |

The losing claim left the statement table at every scale; the renew
statement fell from 7 ms to 1.4 ms once heartbeats jittered. Postgres CPU
barely moved because most of it is outside statement execution, which the
observer cannot attribute yet; that and the 10k-row rung are a ROADMAP
Later item. One three-replica cell was discarded as contaminated by
builds on the same host during its hold.

Verification: build, vet, and `go test -race` on pkg/worker, pkg/consumer,
pkg/alert, pkg/systemmanager, and client; `just test-integration` green
across every domain with the new `TestDeclinedClaimDoesNotWaitOnTheWorkerRowLock`,
which times out without the change; unit tests on the claim backoff curve,
the pool's declined-row skip, and the renewal delay bounds; conventions
show only the pre-existing CLI failure. Cells: `just bench idle-fleet-160
1 2m 1 1`, `idle-fleet-160 1 2m 1 3` (twice, once with a live probe), and
`idle-fleet-1600 1 2m 1 1`, ledgers in `.bench/results/idle-fleet-*/runs.jsonl`.

## 2026-09-12 — SQLStreams source and distribution owner is allegedlyreliable [0785]

Current module declarations, imports, convention-check paths, documentation
examples and repository links use github.com/allegedlyreliable/sqlstreams.
GoReleaser targets that repository and allegedlyreliable/homebrew-tap;
Chocolatey metadata uses the same owner. Existing benchmark evidence and
historical records retain their identities. The dormant compatibility
harness keeps its actual old Vulkan dependency and imports.

Verification: fmt/build/vet pass in all seven active Go modules; .tools
race tests pass. Existing convention-test paths changed mechanically with
the module name. Website build and targeted Prettier/ESLint pass. GoReleaser
2.18.1 validates and produces six snapshot archives with verified checksums;
the extracted macOS arm64 binary reports its snapshot version and embeds
the renamed CLI module. Generated Homebrew URLs use allegedlyreliable.
Source commit/push, website deployment, versioned releases, and package
manager provisioning remain pending; no release compatibility claim is made.

## 2026-09-12 — Documentation moves to sqlstreams.io and a new Pages project [0782] [0784]

The canonical documentation origin is https://sqlstreams.io. Website
metadata, the version manifest, README links, package-manager URLs, and
newly built library and CLI diagnostic links use it. Existing test
expectations changed only to reflect the diagnostic URL.

After the user deleted vulkan, the replacement sqlstreams Pages project
was created with main as its production branch and deployed at
https://sqlstreams.pages.dev (deployment 09b34475). The user attached the
custom domain and its proxied CNAME; Cloudflare reports it active. HTTP
and HTTPS www redirects preserve paths and query strings. Both deploy
recipes and the frozen-version story examples target the new project.

Verification: site build, targeted Prettier/ESLint, Astro and Svelte type
checks, and affected Go fmt/build/vet/race tests passed. Live homepage,
docs and diagnostic pages return 200 with valid TLS; canonical links,
sitemap, robots.txt, and version manifest use sqlstreams.io, with manifest
CORS intact. No database changes or release tags were made.

## 2026-09-12 — Idle-fleet worker-load benchmark measured [0779]

The `idle-fleet-16/160/1600` bench family declares one group per stream and
produces nothing; every replica runs a session on every group. The observer
now samples `pg_stat_statements` per statement shape once a second and the
checker reports each shape's calls/s, share of statement time, and ms/call
beside Postgres CPU, on every scenario. Printed scenarios collapse a run of
identical counted streams to one range line. Six full-scale cells ran:
one replica idles at 0.2 cores for 126 worker rows and 0.6 for 990; three
replicas at 990 rows spend 92% of statement time waiting on the losing
claim's row lock; 9,630 rows saturate eight cores and never finish
registering (verdict unknown, retained). The cost is the group manager's
one-second tick and its re-claims of the three shared system rows; the fix
is rung 2 (idle backoff in the tick runner), a lock-free losing claim, and
system rows off the group manager's chain, as one ROADMAP item.

Verification: `.bench` go fmt, build, vet, and go test -race passed (40
tests); scenario files regenerated and diffed by their test. Cells ran
under `just bench idle-fleet-<n> 1 2m 1 <replicas>` on Postgres 18.4; the
1,600 cells' numbers are hand-computed from their retained records over
the last ten minutes because the checker could not resolve a group.

## 2026-09-12 — CLI migration naming aligns with the client [0777]

Migration up/down uses --target-version and returns target_version in JSON.
Migration status reports registered in JSON and text. Help and recovery
commands use the new flag; --to exits 2. Config default/current comparisons
and multi-series metric reads remain, with their client differences documented
in the reference pages and CLI README.

Verification: CLI go fmt, build, vet, and go test -race passed. All 71 help
pages rendered; 18 usage checks covered the retired flag, required target,
and out-of-range target across all six migration paths. Targeted remark,
Vale, and diff whitespace checks passed. No existing tests changed and no
database operations were run. Go's build cache used /private/tmp after the
sandbox rejected the default cache location.

## 2026-09-12 — CLI alert output and maintenance durations align [0774]

Alert latest JSON returns the alert object or null; history returns an array
or []. Both retain exit 1 when no alert is retained. Maintenance status emits
unclaimed_for as a duration string. Scheduler tables use EXPRESSION and
CONSUMER_GROUP; the undefined-table recovery message says system not registered.
The CLI README and alert/maintenance reference pages describe the output.

Verification: CLI build, vet, go fmt, and go test -race passed. Nineteen
CLI executions against disposable PostgreSQL 18.4 covered populated/empty
alert JSON, history order and limit, missing-owner errors, text output,
maintenance duration strings, scheduler headings, and registration terminology.
The temporary check initially expected stream list on an unregistered system
to fail; it correctly returns an empty list, so the check uses alert latest
for the missing-system case. Existing tests were unchanged. Targeted remark,
Vale, and diff whitespace checks passed. The disposable container was removed.

## 2026-09-12 — CLI naming and resource JSON align [0770] [0771]

Metric list uses --builtin for SQLStreams's metrics across all scopes, and
system binding list names System().Bindings. Both former spellings exit 2.
Stream and scheduler get return the resource directly, preserving duration
strings; scheduler JSON also includes schema_version. Missing stream,
scheduler, consumer, and system gets return null with exit 1 in JSON mode.
Alert examples use declared names. Scheduler help explains that compaction
rules out ordered concurrency; parallel and exclusive remain its choices.

Verification: CLI build, vet, go fmt, and go test -race passed. Forty-one
CLI executions against disposable PostgreSQL 18.4 covered populated/missing
JSON, text, quiet mode, binding scope, built-in/user metric filters, rejected
spellings, help, an exclusive run, and ordered rejection. The initial audit's
ordered claim was corrected after the real produce path rejected compaction;
the temporary check script was corrected for flag parsing order and null
system-metric attributes. Targeted remark, Vale, and diff whitespace checks
passed. The existing command-path test changed for the intentional binding
move; new unit checks reject retired syntax and conflicting metric flags.
The disposable database was removed; library and datastore code are unchanged.

## 2026-09-12 — The idle profile fades and its personal text grows [0769] [0772] [0773] [0775] [0776] [0778]

After four idle seconds on brandon's profile, the surrounding page fades
into the background over 110 seconds while the scrolling personal text
grows from 13px to an apparent 113px. Scrolling slows with enlargement,
reaching about 14.3% of its original pixel speed after easing the slowdown.
Activity restores the
page and normal scrolling speed immediately.
The text container expands to both viewport edges with the fade and updates
when the viewport resizes. The growing line overlaps its surroundings without
moving links. Reduced
motion keeps the static profile; hidden time resets the delay, and leaving
the route removes its listeners and timers. Both board styles are supported.

Verification: site build, targeted ESLint/stylelint/Prettier, Astro check,
and Svelte check passed (existing diagnostics remain). Twenty-one profile flow
checks passed across Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit. Desktop and phone
screenshots in both styles showed no horizontal overflow. The new tests
were corrected for engine-specific matrix rounding and for a paused test
clock preventing idle hydration after Back; existing tests were unchanged.
The slowdown follow-up corrected the profile test's motion preference to
use Playwright's typed contextOptions; its existing assertions were unchanged.
The lighter slowdown passed the site build, targeted lint/format checks,
and the unchanged scrolling-speed test in all three browsers.
The three-second delay passed the build, lint/format checks, and all 18
profile checks. Initial-delay and hidden-tab timing assertions changed
from 4,999ms to 2,999ms to match the requested behavior.
Viewport-width expansion passed all 21 checks, including intermediate and
full width, resizing to a phone viewport, no horizontal overflow, and
restoration. Desktop/phone screenshots were inspected; build, type checks,
and targeted lint/format checks passed. Existing tests were unchanged.
The four-second delay passed the build, lint/format checks, and all 21
profile checks. Initial-delay and hidden-tab assertions moved from 2,999ms
to 3,999ms to match the requested timing.
Flows used a temporary runner configuration against an isolated preview
because the repository's preview startup command exited before serving.
The review sketch and the completed ROADMAP/TODO entries were removed.

## 2026-09-12 — CLI registration, health, and worker reads align [0768]

Stream get reads only registration and config; stream health owns the
payload-version verdicts and their JSON array. Consumer get/list expose
Get/Consumers, and consumer worker list replaces consumer config get while
preserving its stored-config projection and optional key filter. Consumer
get/list and system get support --quiet consistently with existing reads.
Help, README examples, and the handle reference pages describe these paths.

Verification: CLI build, vet, go fmt, and go test -race passed. Thirty-three
CLI executions against disposable PostgreSQL 18 covered populated, empty,
and missing reads; text/JSON output; quiet checks; key filtering; and usage
errors. Targeted site remark and Vale checks passed. The existing consumer
command-path test changed because config get was intentionally retired;
new unit tests cover its rejection and quiet/JSON conflicts before dialing.

## 2026-09-12 — CLI commands mirror client verbs [0766]

The CLI uses scheduler get/status/messages, metric and alert latest/history,
stream key compaction-head, system register, and metric --series-limit.
History limits control counts only. Unknown nested commands now exit 2;
removed spellings have no aliases. Scheduler get returns its config alone,
with status and messages available as separate JSON arrays. Registration
reports registered:true and documents that it reapplies default system config.
Help, recovery commands, README examples, and site references use these names.

Verification: CLI build, vet, go fmt, and go test -race passed; the touched
scheduler package built and has no tests. Twelve binary help checks passed;
nine obsolete command/flag forms returned exit 2. Targeted site remark and
Vale checks passed; git diff --check passed. Existing alert-selector and
recovery-command tests were updated because their old command names were
intentionally removed; selector validation remains covered for both latest
and history. Added unit checks for read-flag separation and nested-command
usage errors. No datastore or signal paths changed.

## 2026-09-12 — Multi-stream ceiling measured; ladder retired [0758] [0759] [0767]

The benchmark checker now reloads progress snapshots after the drain on
aggregate-recording runs, so handled totals match produced (a scaled
max-throughput run reports 2,364,500 for both), and CountLost finds a
duplicate produce's row by key since the library reports message id 0 for
it. Partition creation runs in an explicit transaction: the pipelined
batch did apply its lock timeout but logged a Postgres WARNING per
partition [0759]. The debug buffer costs 142 ns, 512 B, and three
allocations per four-line healthy operation, measured with benchstat over
ten repetitions, and stays always-on [0758].

Nine full-length multistream ladder runs (three per stream count, all
passing) stopped at 4,300 to 4,700/s total at every stream count: the
producer's default ten-connection pool, not the database. The ladder is
retired for three unpaced two-minute holds [0767], which read production
near 50,000/s at every stream count, consumption 42,000/s on one stream
and 90,000/s on four and sixteen, Postgres at up to 6.1 of 8 cores, and
WAL flat at about 2 KB per message. Streams do not contend in Postgres.
Three further repetitions per stream count (twelve unpaced runs in all,
every one passing) put the medians and ranges on the benchmarks page as a
multi-stream section, with the default-pool guidance. The item's recording
question is settled by the per-scenario `runs.jsonl` ledgers and the
report role; the ROADMAP item is closed.

Verification: produce integration tests, `.bench` and `.tools/conventions`
tests, a passing quiet smoke and a passing scaled max-throughput run
through Compose, and the twelve multistream verdicts under
`.bench/results/multistream-*/`.

## 2026-09-12 — Smaller Accept all meme downloads [0765]

The modal uses a 15,762-byte WebP still and a 591,668-byte animated WebP,
removing 493,048 bytes from its image downloads. Originals remain available
for regeneration; placements and displayed widths stay unchanged.

Verification: website build, targeted Prettier and ESLint passed. Animation
metadata matches all 22 frames, 100ms delays, infinite looping, and original
frame dimensions. Chromium confirmed playback and a visual comparison at
2× display density; the built cookie-notice bundle references the WebPs.

## 2026-09-12 — Smaller avatar downloads [0764]

Posts use an 88px-wide WebP (1,968 bytes); the member profile uses a
176px-wide WebP (4,346 bytes), replacing the shared 94,408-byte PNG download.
The original remains available for regeneration. Rendered dimensions stay
44px and 88px, with transparency preserved.

Verification: website build, targeted Prettier and ESLint passed. Built
Quickstart and profile HTML reference the correct copied assets. Chromium
comparison at 2× display density confirmed the appearance, with some
softening from resizing and lossy compression.

## 2026-09-12 — Header wordmark returns home [0763]

The SQLStreams header wordmark links to `/`, with the accessible name
“SQLStreams home” and the existing keyboard focus indicator.

Verification: website build, targeted component formatting and ESLint passed.
Chromium checks at 1280px and 375px confirmed logo clicks and Enter return
from Quickstart to home, with a visible focus indicator.

## 2026-09-12 — Client imports need no explicit alias [0762]

Kept `client/` in the root module with package name `sqlstreams`. Removed
redundant import aliases from maintained Go code, README, and site examples.
The convention import scanner recognizes the declared client package name.

Verification: formatting, build, and vet passed in all five affected Go
modules. Convention race tests passed; a temporary unaliased import opening
a connection was rejected by the existing unit-test check. Site example
formatting and diff whitespace checks passed. No go.mod changes.

## 2026-09-12 — Repository cleanup and reference audit [0761]

Removed the obsolete Starlight starter README, ignored compatibility worktrees,
replaced the missing logo-sheet link with the retained brand assets, and
corrected the voice guide's retired archive reference. Corrected 37 decision
ledger titles to match their records, excluding the record-number prefix.
Root Markdown documents, decision bodies, and historical benchmark evidence
remain in place. No Git history rewrite or permanent audit tooling.

Registered the existing Maintenance page in the reference board, repaired
five alert links, and extended the decision Markdown transform so relative
record filenames become working site routes, including fragments.

Verification: website build, Astro check, targeted ESLint and formatting,
and all 13 decision-transform tests passed. The fresh rendered-site crawl
passed for local navigation, assets, and anchors; the 404 page's error-route
canonical was excluded. Markdown targets and GitHub source targets resolve
locally. Sixteen external targets returned HTTP 200; Claude and RabbitMQ
returned HTTP 403 and remain unverified. The Git index contains no compiled
executables or tracked files matching ignore rules; historical executable
blobs remain by request.

## 2026-09-12 — Client package moves to the module root [0760]

Moved `pkg/sqlstreams` to `client/` within the existing root module, keeping
package name `sqlstreams` and all 29 files unchanged. Callers now import
`github.com/agentstax/sqlstreams/client`. Updated maintained imports,
documentation, and convention scans; no new go.mod or forwarding package.

Verification: formatting, build, and vet passed in all six affected Go
modules; client race tests and the convention suite passed. Deliberate
violations confirmed that type-name and database-connection checks inspect
`client/`; both passed again after removing the fixture. The website built.

Follow-up sweep: corrected scan comments and architecture placement, named
client convention tests for their subject, and added the README import.
All 1,793 tracked text files were inspected for stale paths; remaining old
paths describe history. Tooling formatting, build, vet, and race tests passed
again, as did formatting of the updated site page.

## 2026-09-11 — Benchmark commands and runs use bench [0755]

Renamed the commands to `just bench`, `just bench-smoke`, and
`just bench-report`; the binary, Compose project, and new run identifiers
also use bench. Updated current documentation and diagnostics, removed the
obsolete local binary, and labeled published reproduction commands as using
frozen source. Recorded evidence and historical names remain intact.

Verification: Go formatting, build, and vet passed; the container image and
website built. Recipe dry runs resolve the new binary, and `bench-report quiet`
reads the existing results.

## 2026-09-11 — Benchmark runs share configuration and output [0754]

Manager builds Compose images once before repetitions and supplies the same
role arguments to native processes and containers. Compose no longer repeats
scenario commands or their environment-variable translation. Checker writes
its verdict and report into Manager's run directory, alongside declaration,
fingerprint, logs, and retained measurements; it creates no second timestamp
directory. Native runtime tuning now comes from the caller's Go environment.

Verification: .bench build, vet, and race tests passed. Native completion,
child failure, interruption, and reuse rejection passed. Two Compose
repetitions passed using one build phase, with one directory per repetition,
two run-index entries, and no duplicated measurement files or remaining
project containers and volumes.

Extended setup verification: the Just entry point, all five native scenarios
(shortened), deliberate failed and unknown verdicts, native durability
rejection, and Compose custom declarations with consumer schedule changes,
two replicas, two repetitions, and killed-consumer cleanup behaved as expected.
CLI checks found and fixed non-finite time scales reaching execution. The
three-minute aggregate run and a shorter reproduction exposed stale final
handler totals and a PostgreSQL partition-creation warning; both are recorded
under the benchmark ROADMAP item. These runs validate setup behavior, not
published sustained capacity.

## 2026-09-11 — Proposed site pages exist only for features a user consumes [0752]

The doc-page-first rule now applies only to a feature a user consumes;
developer tooling is specced in ROADMAP/TODO and its record. Deleted from
the site: the demo page and its ChaosDiagram component, the
reliability-lab concept page (its two Proposed sections were bench
tooling specs, the rest .bench operator documentation), and the
metrics-export and alert-history concept pages that had been the otel and
history-alert round's proposal. Their reader-facing facts moved to the
metrics and alerts reference threads; the chaos-run shape and the demo
command are roadmap items. The site roadmap page no longer claims e2e
failure-injection tests or an absence of throughput numbers. AGENTS.md
and ROADMAP.md dropped references to root drafts and archive files that
no longer exist.

Verification: `astro check` and `astro build` pass with no link to a
removed page.

## 2026-09-11 — Manager coordinates native and Compose benchmark runs [0753]

One Go Manager owns the existing role lifecycle; the Just recipe builds and
invokes it. Native runs use POSTGRES_* against a supplied empty database and
leave it intact. Compose retains its own stack and resource limits. Removed
native.py and the draft's separate database wrapper, source copying, storage
scans, and configuration dumps. Observer samples local role CPU; unmeasured
service CPU is null in JSON and unavailable in reports.

Verification: .bench build, vet, and race tests passed. Native completion
with two consumer processes, child failure, interruption, and database reuse
rejection passed, with no role connections left behind and the supplied
database preserved. Compose completion with two consumers and interruption
passed; owned containers and volumes were removed. These were lifecycle
smoke checks, not new sustained-throughput results.

## 2026-09-11 — E2E programs reduced to the one that needs a process [0736]

Audited all 61 programs under `.tests/e2e/` against the test-kind rule:
only `signal` needs a second process or a signal, so it is the one e2e
test left. Seven datastore invariants the programs alone pinned moved to
integration tests -- claims return only a key's compaction head on both
paths, an expired lease reclaims under a rotated token, bindings filter at
claim time, a claim over a dropped partition advances past the hole, a
dead ordered predecessor releases its key's lane, a drop pass ignores
another stream's lagging cursor, and the compaction head prefers the
newer schema version -- and two pure closed sets became unit tests: alert
classify and the schema-support classification. The other 58 programs
were deleted: 15 duplicated an integration test, 8 were benchmarks with
no assertion, the rest observed a controller, admin guard, or runner
behavior the rule leaves untested; `consumer` is now the CLI's
`sqlstreams demo consumer`. `producer` and `systemregister` stay as the
`just produce` and `just system-register` recipes. The consume, stream,
and produce integration packages ran green under -race with the new
tests, 56 in all.

## 2026-09-11 — Results retained by maintained scenario family [0751]

Renamed dev results to quiet without changing recorded declarations, durations,
identities, or verdicts. Kept max-throughput, multitopic family results, and
published evidence. Removed throughput exploration, check-* validation runs,
_controls, the retired-source archive, and fingerprint/statistics scratch.
The user also removed the historical experiments preserved in the earlier
cleanup. Updated report instructions, current references, and ignore rules.

## 2026-09-11 — Benchmark workloads reduced to recurring questions [0750]

Quiet and max-throughput remain the steady-delivery and sustained-capacity
baselines; multi-stream remains an experimental deployment comparison. Dev
is replaced by `just reliability-smoke`, a one-minute quiet run. The lab recipe
requires a scenario, and the short throughput declaration is retired. Reports
still read historical scenario names without an active declaration.

Retired 50 tracked source files from the independent claim, compaction,
fillfactor, scale, trigger-fanout, and native scratch experiments. Their exact
source is frozen in `.bench/results/retired-source-2026-09-11.tar.gz`; historical
results, published evidence, design notes, and local scratch evidence remain.
No new benchmark or correctness-test scenario was introduced. The existing
scenario lookup test now selects quiet because dev is intentionally retired.

Validation: benchmark build, vet, formatting, and targeted race tests passed.
CLI checks covered all five declarations, retired-name rejection, and historical
reports. Smoke recipe expansion and the site build passed. All 51 existing
evidence files are unchanged, and all 50 archived sources match their originals.
No database benchmark or full e2e suite was run for this cleanup.

Completed the directory cleanup by moving the seven remaining experiment
folders under `.bench/results/historical/` and removing the empty trigger-fanout
folder. The root now holds the shared runner and results. Updated current
ROADMAP references and relative result links. All 30 tracked records and 12,199
local files were preserved; native and idempotency scratch remain ignored.
Build, vet, formatting, move-integrity, and ignore-rule checks passed.

## 2026-09-11 — Benchmark runner promoted to .bench [0749]

Moved the reliability lab's entry point, packages, scripts, Compose stack,
and results to `.bench/`. Existing Just commands retain their names. Imports,
Docker build paths, native source capture, ignore rules, and current evidence
links follow the move. Published evidence and frozen reproduction commands
retain their original contents. Other benchmark programs remain separate.

Validation: benchmark build, vet, formatting, and targeted race tests passed;
Compose paths, evidence hashes, and scenario/report commands checked. No
database workload or full e2e suite was run for this mechanical move.

## 2026-09-11 — Sustained throughput measured and documented [0747] [0748]

The reliability lab reproduces the native scratch throughput with optional
aggregate recording. Throughput scenarios skip per-message recording and
retain progress, error, backlog, and resource checks; identity, schedule,
and detailed latency checks explicitly report unavailable. Existing full
recording scenarios retain their behavior. CPU headroom is informational
for maximum-throughput runs.

Three runs from one frozen source and binary each used five minutes of
warmup and 25 minutes of measurement. The lower producing/consuming rates
were 74,129.26/s, 68,184.89/s, and 66,140.77/s: median 68,184.89/s. All
three passed, with matching final aggregate counts totaling 398,139,000
messages including warmup. Run 1 logged two janitor lock-timeout retries;
these remain disclosed. This is a measured host/workload result, not an
absolute ceiling or an exactly-once claim.

The configuration uses native durable PostgreSQL 18.6 on an M4 MacBook Air,
1 KB messages, four producer callers with batches of 250, pools of eight,
and four consumer handlers. Retention, janitor grace, and opt-in scheduled
key vacuum keep cleanup active. The investigation found full recording
limited the lab measurement; larger pools did not consistently improve
throughput. Storage writes and maintenance remain relevant costs, without
claiming a proven SSD firmware or kernel root cause. Combined storage stayed
below 100 GB and every measurement database was removed.

README and /benchmarks/ report approximately 68k messages/s with all three
outcomes, configuration, limitations, a chart, and downloadable evidence.
Source/build identity, records, logs, settings, and checksums are retained
in `.bench/results/published/2026-09-11/`. Temporary publication
scripts were removed. Future multi-stream, latency, idle-fleet, and logging
measurements remain separate work.

Validation: benchmark build, vet, and race tests passed before the measured
build was frozen; native checker integration tests and all three publication
runs passed. Targeted prose and structure checks passed. No fresh full e2e
suite was run for this benchmark milestone.

Close-out: corrected superseded-status metadata in [0730] and [0731],
preserving links to [0736]. Site build and search indexing passed; Astro
reported zero errors or warnings. Desktop/mobile browser checks found and
fixed chart overflow with the existing article image styles. CSS formatting
and lint, evidence checksums, and diff checks passed. Deployed with approval
to the main site; the live benchmark headline, evidence link, and chart were
verified (deployment 3b6cfb61).

## 2026-09-11 — Test suite: unit beside the code, integration over testcontainers [0736] [0737]

Every test is one of three kinds: a unit test beside the code with no I/O
and no clock, an integration test in the nested dev-only `.tests` module
against a Postgres container with a schema per test, or an e2e program.
The subject of an integration test is a domain's datastore driven through
its verbs, from an approved promise list per root. Every root has its
directory under `.tests/integration/`: worker, consume, stream, schedule,
metric, produce, compaction, migrate, system; alert has one settings-read
verb and gets none. Five `(checked)` rules in `.tools/conventions` pin the
kinds: no connect verb or sleep in a unit test, no copied CREATE TABLE
text, the test database variable read only by the Docker seam, and no
e2e program declaring its own helpers -- every program takes Must, Die,
Assert, Recover, and the pool from `.tests/e2e/common`. The `sqlstreams`
CLI resolves its connection before it dials, so its tests are dial-free.
`pkg/sqlstreamstest` is gone.

The suite ran green under -race, then twice with shuffled order, on
2026-09-11. `just signal-e2e` covers a killed producer, a producer and a
consumer under SIGTERM, and a second SIGTERM past a hung handler, green
against the development database.

## 2026-09-10 — Maximum-throughput scenario in the reliability lab [0745]

The lab supports bounded unpaced callers, explicit batches, declared
retention and maintenance settings, explicit warmup, and native PostgreSQL
execution. Existing paced scenarios and zero-rate idle phases retain their
meaning. Expired acknowledged messages remain subject to handler and durable
completion checks; absent CPU or backlog measurements produce unknown.

Targeted lab build, vet, and race tests passed. Six native controls cover
paced/idle success, deliberately missing retained rows and expired-message
handler evidence, and missing CPU/backlog telemetry. The ten-minute native
`max-throughput` run passed all checks for 38,246,000 messages; its final
five minutes produced 52,573/s and consumed 58,721/s while draining backlog.
This does not reproduce the scratch reference of 65k/s. Full ledger overhead
and differing library revisions remain unresolved comparison factors.
Evidence: `.bench/results/max-throughput/20260910T232140Z/` and
`reliability_20260910_191122/`. Exception consumers stayed stopped during
measurement, maintenance failures were zero, peak storage was 65.1GB, and
the disposable database was dropped. Raw records are retained compressed.

## 2026-09-10 — Stream maintenance settings and operations [0742] [0743] [0744]

StreamConfig declares parallel JanitorConfig and VacuumConfig settings;
stream maintenance handles expose Suspend, Unsuspend, and Status. New
streams start with janitor active and vacuum suspended. Registration
preserves operational targets; explicit target updates are atomic and
audited. Running workers observe suspension on heartbeat and release after
stopping. Status reports live claims and failures. Scheduled key vacuum uses the existing manager and pool.
Admin reuses its stream/system controllers and owns worker declarations.
Worker registration takes an explicit initial target through one validated
path; zero is never replaced by a default.
The CLI mirrors janitor and vacuum Suspend, Unsuspend, and Status through
`stream janitor` and `stream vacuum`, including JSON output.

After review, targeted library and CLI race tests, CLI build, and vet passed.
Fresh PostgreSQL 18 worker/stream integration tests passed, including target
preservation, suspension during renewal, and history rollback. A disposable
PostgreSQL 18 CLI check covered both workers' text/JSON output, repeated
operations, target preservation after re-registration, and missing-stream
errors. The running manager claimed vacuum after CLI unsuspend; CLI suspend
then caused it to release its claim. The container was removed afterward.

PostgreSQL 18 race integration checks covered worker and stream persistence,
including target history rollback.
A fresh-database smoke check verified the handle workflow and cooperative
suspension. After registration assembly was revised, targeted build, vet,
race/integration, and convention checks passed. Existing systemregister,
consumergroup, and workerclaim programs passed against disposable PostgreSQL
18 with only their connection port overridden in temporary copies. The
consumergroup source changed only to pass its former default target explicitly.
Successful-pass history and randomized first-pass delay were
removed after review and deferred to Later. No completion-history schema
change remains. No throughput rerun.

## 2026-09-09 — Partial sweep grace applies to every batch [0739]

Removed the first-batch cutoff reset. Each batch now requires its oldest
row to exceed TTL plus grace; an eligible batch keeps the normal TTL
predicate. Native PostgreSQL race regressions cover stopping at the next
batch within grace, eventual cleanup, and consumer protection. Targeted
build, vet and formatting passed. No throughput rerun for this change.

## 2026-09-09 — Partial message sweeps have a bounded grace period [0738]

Per-stream janitor metadata accepts partial_sweep_grace_period (nanoseconds,
zero by default). The indexed oldest-row check defers partial cleanup until
TTL plus grace, then drains the expired prefix using the original TTL.
Whole-partition drops and consumer-progress protection remain unchanged.
Startup logs expose the setting; debug logs identify deferred partitions
and their oldest-row age. No new metric collection or schema change.

Validation: native PostgreSQL integration race tests cover deferral,
multi-batch draining, sparse partitions, consumer protection, zero grace,
and whole-partition drops. Targeted janitor race tests, builds, vet and
formatting passed. Throughput with bounded grace has not yet been measured.

## 2026-09-09 — Idempotency expiry uses timestamp order [0735]

Idempotency cleanup now orders expired candidates by created_at, using its
existing timestamp index without a new probe or schema change. Young keys
and caller-supplied UUIDs retain their existing expiry behavior.

Validation: targeted janitor database race tests, build and vet passed.
The million-row query experiment measured about 0.08ms with ordering versus
32ms without it before manual ANALYZE. The separate lease-index experiment
showed substantial write overhead, so that index remains deferred. Evidence
is retained in the decision's referenced scratch runs; their DBs were deleted.

## 2026-09-09 — Janitor probes before row expiry scans [0734]

Row-sweep batches stop when the partition is empty or its lowest-id row
has not expired, avoiding full scans of young partitions and the remainder
after partial cleanup. Existing consumer protection and deletion predicates
remain. This uses the accepted approximate id/timestamp ordering; dead
index entries can still make probes expensive until vacuum cleans them.

Validation: targeted janitor database race tests, build and vet. Five warm
million-row sweeps averaged0.314ms intact and0.295ms after a1000-row expired
prefix was cleaned. Evidence: .bench/results/historical/scratchnative/results/evidence/native18/
scratch_janitor_222603. Paired throughput with janitor enabled is not yet
validated; scratch databases were deleted.

## 2026-09-09 — Claim observations use xid [0733]

Renamed the claim observation to xid / Xid and its stored cursor column to
pending_xid across the library, website sandbox, SQL callers, and current
docs. PostgreSQL snapshot xmax references retain their meaning. Existing
cursor tables need the column renamed or recreated before using this code.

Validation: root, e2e, and benchmark modules format/build/vet; claim datastore
database race tests; 24 sandbox tests including SQL parity; Astro and Svelte
type checks; changed website files pass Prettier. No e2e scenarios run for
this mechanical rename.

## 2026-09-09 — Diagnostic codes use SQL [0732]

SQL replaces SS in diagnostic declarations, validation, CLI explain, website
pages and generated data. All 105 declarations retain their numeric serials
and content apart from the prefix. Codes are exactly SQL plus four ASCII
digits; old prefixes are rejected. No compatibility aliases or redirects.

Validation: seven current Go modules build/vet/format; diagnostic, common,
CLI, OTel and tooling race tests; 127 website tests; code-export parity and
`sqlstreams explain SQL0005 --output json`. Deployed with user approval:
`https://d8fa16a9.vulkan-5ss.pages.dev`, serving the main origin. Live title,
wordmark, sandbox, search, stream reference, SQL0005, favicon and manifest
checks passed. Historical records keep the prefix used at the time.

The follow-up consistency audit found stale names in the recipe heading,
agent rules and active planning notes, plus malformed-code tests still using
the old prefix. Those are corrected. Source/module/storage/JSON/telemetry
searches found no unexplained old names; all 105 code pages and internal
Markdown routes match the build. Seven current Go modules build/vet, targeted
race/convention checks and 127 website tests pass. The old compatibility
harness remains pending a real prior-checkout pin. The remaining volcano
avatars use the approved semicolon asset, verified at desktop/mobile widths
and deployed with approval as `2636c430`. Live thread/profile avatars and
SQL0005 returned successfully.

A second Vulkan-to-SQLStreams sweep corrected the decision-index fixture/env
keywords and active roadmap/test-plan names. Historical inventory and run
records retain their original names. Obsolete local CLI/reclaim binaries,
release archives/cask and generated schema diagrams were retained under
`/tmp/sqlstreams-pre-rename-artifacts-6nf6j77b`; `.bin/sqlstreams` was rebuilt
and its module metadata and SQL0005 JSON explain checked. The remaining
Vulkan references in current source are the intentional Pages origin and
old-release compatibility harness. Remote main still declares the Vulkan
module; publishing the reviewed source remains a separate step.

## 2026-09-09 — SQLStreams and stream vocabulary [0725] [0726] [0727] [0729]

The project is SQLStreams: module `github.com/agentstax/sqlstreams`, entry
package `pkg/sqlstreams`, CLI `sqlstreams`, and stream throughout the API,
storage catalog, JSON, diagnostics and telemetry. `SS` replaces `VK` without
changing any of the 105 diagnostic serials. The default schema and environment
prefix are `sqlstreams` and `SQLSTREAMS_`. Neutral per-stream table families,
reserved system stream names and the advisory-lock numeric namespace remain.
Existing databases are disposable; this is a pre-v1 reset, not a migration.

Docs and executable SQL use the new names, and the
approved wordmark ends with an amber semicolon, with SQL also amber. Browser
preference/read-tracking keys change to `sqlstreams-board:*` and reset once.
No rename redirects are needed before public release.
The site is deployed at `https://vulkan-5ss.pages.dev` (deployment
`f4195287`), with live branding, sandbox, search, diagnostic pages and version
manifest verified. The GitHub repository is renamed; permanent-domain and
versioned module/binary publication remain release gates.
Production [SVG/PNG brand assets](../.website/public/) live in `.website/public`.
The completed TODO/ROADMAP rename entries and initial exploration were
removed at close-out; remaining release gates live in ROADMAP.

Validation: seven current Go modules build/vet/format; root, CLI, OTel and
.tools race tests; affected database race tests; downstream module build/vet;
127 website unit tests and 24 browser flows. All 50 fresh-DB e2e programs
passed on isolated PostgreSQL 17, including Prometheus scraping and alert
classification/resolution. The shared database was untouched. The old-API
compatibility harness needs its prior-checkout pin before release validation.

Distribution audit: GoReleaser configuration and an unpublished six-target
snapshot passed, including archive contents/checksums, native version output
and Homebrew cask generation. Chocolatey packaging remains a Windows-runner
check. With no release/module tags or available package listings, READMEs
now describe the verified workspace installation command. No artifacts were
published; permanent-domain and module-version pins remain release gates.

## 2026-09-09 — The metric root is singular [0724]

`pkg/metrics` is `pkg/metric`, and the machinery built on it follows:
`MetricController`, `MetricDatastore`, `MetricProducer`, `MetricCollector`,
`MetricTopicName`, `MetricCollectorProgressAlert`. The CLI group is
`vulkan metric` (`metric list`, `metric get`), matching `vulkan alert`.
Collection handles, `__system.metrics`, the stored worker and alert names,
and `--metrics-address` are unchanged. Mechanical rename: root, cmd/vulkan,
otel, .e2e, .examples, and .tools build, vet, and gofmt clean; unit tests
pass with race detection on the touched packages; the conventions suite
passes.

## 2026-09-07 — Consumer transaction visibility and empty-claim persistence [0714] [0715]

Active cursor-claim observations now allocate their own transaction id,
so a producer still running at or above snapshot xmax cannot be skipped.
Empty claims commit their pending observation for later polls. Caught-up
polls remain read-only. No public API or table-layout change.

Two deterministic claim regressions failed before the fixes. Database
regressions passed with race detection on PostgreSQL 17.10 and 18.4, and
the reclaim lab passed on PostgreSQL 17.10. Delivery-consumer changes and
tests were removed after the user clarified that path is archived. Root build, targeted consumer vet/race
checks, and the documentation build pass. Two repeated 32k/s, 30s reliability
runs handled all 1.92 million messages with no missing/duplicate deliveries,
but still failed backlog/latency limits. A corrected 16k/s, 30s baseline
passed with all 480,000 messages handled and overall p99 248.5ms. Evidence is in
bench/results/throughput/RESULTS.md; no sustained-rate claim.

## 2026-09-07 — Documentation onboarding and explanation pass [0712]

Quickstart now supplies two complete programs, filenames, connection setup,
run commands, expected output, and cancellation guidance, ending at the first
produce/consume result. Getting Started leads with it; Concepts introduces
consumer groups and delivery behavior before architecture and table design.

Lifecycle and Architecture use compact tables and causal steps instead of
wide text diagrams. Lifecycle includes delays, deferred state, and superseded
exceptions; Fan-out separates cursor distance from pending and dead deliveries.
Ordering and registration internals moved to concept pages. Transactional
Produce leads with verb selection and makes its rollback check specific to
one order. Replay and Schema Versions show error handling; schema version
storage now correctly says INTEGER. Orientation states database and upkeep
costs. Side Effects distinguishes message deduplication from business-write
idempotency. No library, layout, dependency, or documentation-tooling changes.

The two extracted Quickstart programs compiled and produced/consumed message 1
in an isolated schema using the existing test role. Inspection queries ran;
the schema was removed and its absence verified. Fresh-install alert-evidence
warnings are explained in Quickstart. Immediate SIGINT after handler output
also logged an unresolved-range warning, consistent with the documented
redelivery boundary; the consumer exited successfully.

Site build, targeted Prettier/ESLint/remark/Vale checks, rendered internal-link
checks, and the existing Chromium title/search flows passed. Browser control
was unavailable, so manual desktop/mobile visual inspection remains unverified.
The root review was folded into this entry and [0712], then removed.

## 2026-09-07 — Responsive consumer defaults [0710]

ConsumeOptions now defaults to BatchLimit 4, ClaimPollRate 500ms, and
QueueMargin 15s. QueueSize still follows BatchLimit; concurrency remains 1.
The default range lease is 47.1s and the derived shutdown budget stays 32.1s.
New sessions adopt these defaults without a migration. An explicit QueueSize
below 4 requires an explicit compatible BatchLimit.

The starting log includes queue, concurrency, poll, and timing budgets.
VK0105 identifies queued messages that cannot start with sufficient lease
coverage, once per locally tracked range subject to existing suppression.
The consumer reference documents sizing and replay costs. The consumer-tuning
guide adds profiles for local and quiet consumers, fast and long handlers,
mixed runtimes, ordered keys, and large payloads. Research and
measurements are preserved in bench/consumerdefaults/RESULTS.md.

Affected builds and race tests, the concurrent warning-winner test, existing
conventions checks, targeted prose checks, and the site build passed.
Group-config, ordered, and shutdown-truncation labs passed in isolated schemas.
An eight-message, three-second-handler smoke test with zero session options
completed in 24.08s with no repeats, exceptions, or open leases. All isolated
schemas were removed. Initial development-schema labs could not run because
worker_instance_log was absent; the development schema was not reset.

## 2026-09-07 — One-minute topic-alert cadence [0709]

Partition count, compaction read cost, and worker liveness now default to
@every 1m. Explicit expressions remain unchanged; existing schedules adopt
the default when the system is redeclared. Collector sampling, pending/gap,
retention, and repeat policy are unchanged. No query or index changes.

The reproducible checkpoint in bench/alertcadence/RESULTS.md uses the existing
Evaluate/Record path on disk-backed Postgres 18.4. At 100 owners with 4.896
million retained rows, three measured combined passes had median 14.459s and
maximum 15.159s. The measured path updates 300 alert heads per combined pass
even when alerts do not change; the record states excluded scheduling and
summary costs and does not claim capacity beyond the measured workloads.

Affected builds/race tests, alert-lab, worker-liveness-lab, targeted site prose
checks, and the site build passed. Real registration persisted @every 1m for
all three schedules. Labs ran inside the isolated Postgres 18 container;
the development database was untouched. The cadence follow-up is complete.

## 2026-09-07 — Metrics export and history-based alerts close-out [0693] [0698] [0703] [0704] [0705] [0707] [0708]

Exporter health now has collection scope in the existing diagnostic catalog,
public vocabulary, and generated site data. Resource selectors remain complete;
no stored-value selectors or second registry were added. Alerts reject the new
non-resource scope.

Real scheduled compaction-read-cost and collector-progress workers, under a
claimed manager with controlled measurement inputs, verify pending without
publication, stop/restart gaps, sustained activation, quiet repeated checks,
and one recovery message. The collector is suspended in this fixture; the
earlier full lab sweep verified real collector production separately.
The worker/snapshot/database-history and affected alert/metrics tests pass twice
under race detection. Diagnostic tests pass in a fresh process; repeating their
whole suite in one process re-registers an existing test metric and panics.

Whole-repository Go verification, OTel race tests, targeted site prose checks,
and the site build pass. The preceding checkpoint's 52 passing labs remain the
full-suite result; no release or newly pinned prior-tag compatibility claim.
Hourly topic-alert defaults are unchanged. The proposed one-minute cadence and
its cost measurement move to ROADMAP as follow-up work.

The original OTel review is folded into decisions [0703] [0705] [0707]: reader
ownership removes callback registration/discovery state, collection health and
collector progress distinguish source reads from liveness, and per-collection
validation isolates rejected families. Current conventions retain resolved config
pointers; the site states their no-mutation contract. The completed review and
implementation checklist are removed.

## 2026-09-07 — Reader lifecycle and lab checkpoint [0693] [0698] [0705] [0707]

Pinned-reader race checks verify periodic failure isolation/recovery, cancellation
of active periodic collection, a bounded final shutdown collection, and
Prometheus scrapes finishing after provider Close. Docs state HTTP server ->
provider -> caller pool shutdown ordering. Alert and worker-liveness labs now
read collector-owned evidence; the collector lab covers the new alert metrics.
All 52 lab recipes passed: 50 on the first fresh-database sweep, two on fresh
reruns after collector assertion repair and removal of cross-lab lease interference.
The original development volume was preserved. Root verification found an open
exporter-health catalog-scope mismatch; cadence and remaining real-worker
pending checks remain in TODO. No release or prior-tag compatibility claim.

## 2026-09-07 — OTel producer collection verification [0705] [0707]

Isolated PostgreSQL tests pass in three repeated race-enabled runs for concurrent
ManualReader collections and Prometheus scrapes, naming-conflict recovery,
bounded connection waits, and replacement metrics-topic lookup. Existing
conversion and caller-pool ownership tests pass. Docs clarify that a pre-canceled
ManualReader call stops before invoking the producer and returns no health gauge.
No production changes; periodic-reader and in-flight shutdown checks remain next.

## 2026-09-07 — Portable export validation and read health [0706]

The OTel producer rejects conflicting or reserved metric families using the
pinned upstream translator while exporting healthy families. Collection-local
VK0102/VK0103 report source-read success and rejected measurement counts;
VK0104 identifies rejected families without logging values or metadata.
Review narrowed checks to export compatibility: core constructors own basic
validity, and rejected families no longer block eligible families [0707].
Targeted race and PostgreSQL tests passed for empty reads, partial rejection,
source failure and recovery through ManualReader and Prometheus. Reader
concurrency and shutdown checks remain in flight.

## 2026-09-07 — OTel SDK producer replacement [0705]

Metrics.Produce reads current retained values through the core metrics
controller. ManualReader and the convenience Prometheus exporter use the
producer directly; instrument registration, callbacks, and cached topic
identity are removed. Targeted race and PostgreSQL tests cover conversion,
new-name collection, cancellation, metadata exclusion, and caller pool
ownership. Portable rejection and source-read health remain in flight.

## 2026-09-07 — Read-only alert evaluation snapshots [0704]

All four built-in alert handles expose Snapshot using the existing evaluator
under current declared policy. Snapshots include state, finding, evidence
timing, resolved timing settings, and an insufficient-evidence reason.
Scheduled checks retain consumed policy; recorded alert semantics are unchanged.
Targeted race tests and PostgreSQL read-only selector checks passed. Real-worker
labs and the full-suite checkpoint remain deferred.

## 2026-09-07 — Reliability lab v1: records, a checker, two scenarios [0687] [0696] [0697]

`bench/reliability/` runs a scenario on its own compose stack (`just
reliability-lab dev`): an open-loop producer and one process of consumer
instances write JSON-lines records of every produce and handler call; the
checker COPYs them into a `lab` schema (`produce_record`, `handler_record`,
`run_phase`), drains on the group's cursor, joins them against
`message_log`, `delivery_log`, and `exception_queue`, and exits with the
verdict (0 pass, 1 fail, 2 unknown, 3 lab failure). Packages: `runner` (one
role per process), `record` (the row shapes and writer), `producer` and
`consumer` (the recording sides), `checker` (the judgment) over
`checker/datastore` (every query), `scenario` and `scenarios`, `common`.
Scenarios are hand-written Go (`quiet`, `dev`) printed as `.scenario` files
a test diffs; every scenario must declare the six safety checks. The record
lands under `results/<scenario>/<timestamp>/` with `synchronous_commit` and
the build version. `dev` passed the compose ladder at 15s, 1m, 5m, 20m, and
1h (720000 attempted, committed, and handled, zero unknown, duplicates,
reclaims, or dead); sabotage turned the verdict to fail on the right line (a
deleted message_log row -> lost, a dropped handler line -> undelivered) and
no records reads unknown. `just verify` vets and race-tests the lab.
Proposal page relabeled to shipped behavior with the chaos run kept as
Proposed.

## 2026-09-06 — Compaction options are constructed inline [0691]

Removed NewCompactionOptions and its Vulkan alias. Library callers, examples,
benchmarks, and current docs use inline options; ranks and produce-time
validation are unchanged. Builds, vet, conventions, docs lint, site build,
and compaction-rank, schema-evolution, metrics-collector, and alert labs passed.
Targeted race tests passed except two Vulkan metric-catalog assertions affected
by the separate in-flight alert-metric addition. No full-suite checkpoint.

## 2026-09-06 — Claim poll round trips cut; the gate reads as one rule [0685]

The cursor claim was measured before it was touched (`bench/claim`): its
SQL runs in ~150µs server-side, the CTE gate in 29µs, and the rest of a
claim is round trips, one WAL fsync, and payload transfer. So the change
is fewer round trips, not different SQL. `readClaimSnapshot` now runs
first as one autocommit statement carrying an `EXISTS (expired lease)`
flag; the reclaim transaction opens only when that flag is true, the
caught-up short-circuit runs outside any transaction, and the fresh
claim's transaction begins straight into the cursor statement. Idle poll
6 -> 1 round trips, fresh claim 9 -> 6 [0685]. The gate CTE lists its
three candidate (head, xmax) pairs as a VALUES table under one fence
predicate. `protectedInsertSQL` states the precondition the fence rests
on: the idempotency claim CTE assigns the produce's txid before nextval
issues the message id. The doc-site sandbox mirrors regenerated from the
Go literals. Collapsing the fresh claim to one pipelined batch is parked
in ROADMAP with its prototype and numbers.

Build, vet, gofmt, tools/conventions, reclaim-lab, exception-lab, and
the website sandbox tests pass.

## 2026-09-06 — Rule files reorganized; pkg/concurrency under common [0680] [0681]

CONVENTIONS.md was reorganized into five parts (where code lives, how it
reads, persistence, diagnostics, outside the library) with no rule
removed: eight rules stated twice now appear once, the orphan signature
rule joined ## Naming & terminology, Package layout gave up config naming,
validation, code placement, and the tools/ paragraph to the sections that
own them, and the type-suffix, table-kind, column-name, and log-attribute
enumerations became tables. Every rule a tools/conventions test enforces
ends in `(checked)`; inline `[NNNN]` citations are gone from both rule
files, DECISION_MAP being the index [0681]. Stale facts fixed: the
declared-condition count, the VK0005 fix text in the Errors example, a
Comments example naming a nonexistent identifier. AGENTS.md opens with
Hard limits (never commit, ask before deploy, "show me" edits nothing),
leads Docs & record-keeping with the lifecycle, and names THOUGHTS.md, the
tabled drafts a ROADMAP item cites, and docs/archive on the surface.

`pkg/concurrency` moved to `pkg/common/concurrency` so the three-package-
kinds rule holds without an exception [0680]. `just verify` runs tools/
with `-count=1`. README's architecture link gained a caption.

Build, vet, gofmt, `go test -race` on the moved package and its importers,
and tools/conventions pass; its attribute-registry parser now reads the
### Attributes markdown table and was sabotage-checked (a renamed row
fails 56 raise sites).

## 2026-09-06 — The doc site splits by page kind: a Reference board [0679]

guides/client.mdx (7,300 words, 28 H2s, 40% of the site's prose) was four
kinds of page in one file. It became a Reference board: an index thread plus
thirteen threads, one per handle or instance and per shared value type, each
on one skeleton (the opening example, Verbs, Config with defaults from the
declaration's Default: line, Gotchas), checked against pkg/vulkan's
signatures and config structs. Its explanation sections became
concepts/api-shape; its changelog residue was deleted. handler-outcomes and
consumer-group-config moved from Guides to Concepts so every board holds one
kind of thread, and consumer-group-config lost its per-instance sections to
the reference threads. Three redirects keep the old URLs, the nav gains a
Reference link, and website/CONVENTIONS.md ## Content gained the board
kinds, the page-size triggers, and the reference-thread skeleton. One stale
claim fixed on the way: a new group on `__system.alerts` starts at the
beginning of retained history, not at head.

remark-lint, Vale at error level, Prettier and ESLint on the edited
TypeScript, astro check, svelte-check, Vitest, the Playwright flows, the
site build with its Pagefind index, and a scratch-module compile of every
Go fence on the new pages pass.

## 2026-09-06 — Public API documentation review closed [0677]

Audited every declaration reachable through `vulkan` against the code, with
the alias closure as the inventory. Fixed the claims the code contradicted
(MessageOptions defaults, Health's data source, the TopicConfig TTL zero
semantics), sixteen stale verb names, and about thirty missing contracts:
Default: lines, returned Err* variables, cancellation, destructive effects,
handler outcomes. About sixty uncommented reachable declarations gained a
comment; protocol methods and self-describing fields stayed bare. Deleted
the Validate convention sentence from 36 files and unified the nil-config
clauses. CONVENTIONS ## Comments gained the public-contract rule and
tools/conventions its Default: walk. Sixteen site pages and six error pages
now spell the client API; two fix strings and one event consequence changed
in Go and codes.json was regenerated. [0664] [0670]

Root build, vet, race tests on the touched packages, the conventions suite,
a scratch-module compile of every rewritten site sample, and prettier and
remark on the edited pages pass. No fresh-DB lab suite was run: the changes
are comments, three diagnostic strings, and site prose.

## 2026-09-06 — Admin responsibilities and validation aligned [0676]

Admin keeps orchestration, identity resolution, and operation policy.
CONVENTIONS.md permits explicit duplication of simple preflight checks and
calls to domain-owned config validation. Topic registration now validates
before bootstrap; invalid names/configs create no system resources. Automatic
bootstrap and custom system settings are preserved. Later database failures
can still leave partial registration progress.

Consumer worker reads now select the group's own rows through the dedicated
worker controller/datastore verb; the manager's owner-chain read is unchanged.
Selected unreadable owners retain warning/skip behavior; ancestor rows are no
longer read or diagnosed by the group-only operation. TopicVersionHealth lives
in pkg/topic, with the verdict computed inline in admin. The vulkan alias,
fields, JSON tags, reason strings, and ordering remain; direct admin type
imports must use the topic declaration.

Removed redundant forwarding guards and moved same-name rename rejection
into the topic controller. Empty topic-read/schedule names now use the
controller's `name is required` wording. Reserved names renamed to themselves
return ErrReservedTopicName first; identical malformed names fail the pattern
check first. The architecture, quickstart, and worker-inspection docs match.

Targeted builds, race tests, conventions/alias checks, and doc formatting/lint
passed. Live labs passed: reserved-topic, schedule, register-idempotency,
consumer-group (with -race), worker-claim, and schema-evolution (with -race).
Coverage includes bootstrap rejection without even creating a namespace,
custom-system preservation, worker ownership isolation, manager failover, and
all three health verdict branches. No full fresh-DB suite or release checkpoint
was run for this work.

## 2026-09-06 — Playground examples use one structure [0674]

All twelve examples reuse topic handles, name handles for their domain and
instances for their activity, declare consumer handles explicitly, and put
consumer handlers below run. Every example uses LifecycleContext; the metrics
handler's simulated wait now observes cancellation. Standardized errgroup
names and setup spacing, and removed stale API-review inventories from headers.
Recorded the selected patterns in CONVENTIONS.md. Targeted playground build
and go test -race passed (the packages contain no test files); no database
scenarios were run.

## 2026-09-06 — Named-result style review closed [0672]

Reverted the nine-signature client and handle trial after playground review:
verbs and concrete return types already identify the results, so naming each
result adds repetition. Recorded the unnamed-result default in CONVENTIONS.md
and closed the TODO and ROADMAP item. Runtime behavior is unchanged.

## 2026-09-06 — Consumer session failure contract retained [0671]

Closed the manager permanent-error roadmap discussion: fatal consumption
errors continue to stop the session and return through Consume. No automatic
instance suspension or shared target change. The client guide now states the
failure boundary, caller-owned recovery, and the effect on paired upkeep.
Runtime behavior is unchanged.

## 2026-09-06 — Scheduled-time column tried and reverted [0673] [0675]

`MessageOptions.ScheduledAt` was moved to `ProduceOptions` and stored as
a `message_log` column, first nullable, then NOT NULL on every message
with a produce-time default, then renamed `sent_at`. Reverted the same
day: the scheduled time is a fact only a schedule's message carries, and
the sparse `options` document already holds exactly that. A column on
every row needed a default that meant nothing and a name that fit
nothing. Code, labs, sandbox mirrors, and doc pages are back to the
pre-item state; both records are rejected.

## 2026-09-06 — Table name and column review [0667] [0668] [0669]

The last naming and column-order pass before v1 makes the DDL expensive to
change. Sixteen automated findings, settled one at a time: twelve shipped,
two reversed into their opposite direction and shipped, one dropped, one
kept. Renames: `message_key_lease.lease_token` -> `token`,
`migration_log.migration_version` -> `version`, `compaction_head.head_id`
-> `message_id`. Every version column is INTEGER (a version is an ordinal;
BIGINT stays for ids, `_ns` durations, sizes, and compaction_rank). Every
`_config` table carries `created_at` and `updated_at` and every config
UPDATE sets it [0667]; schedule_cursor gained the surrogate `id` +
owner-UNIQUE shape of consumer_group_cursor [0668]; twelve indexes are
named `<table>_<leading columns>` [0669]. claim_lease leads with
consumer_group_id in columns and primary key, binding_config declares
`pattern` before `pattern_regex`, schedule_config is ordered identity /
schedule / message / metadata / timestamps, topic_config_log lost a dead
DEFAULT, DDL defaults are uppercase, and the worker_config.name comment
lists all nine worker names. Kept on the user's call: `attempts` on
worker_instance, `declared_at` as is, and `migration_log.consumer_group_id`.

Three conventions tests enforce the new rules, each sabotage-checked; the
DDL walk now names per-topic statements from their table-name call. The
website sandbox mirror was found four literals behind the compaction-head
redesign and re-synced, so its byte-exact drift test guards every column
move again. The exclusive lab now surfaces a background Run error instead
of timing out. Full fresh-DB suite: 51 of 51 labs passed.

## 2026-09-06 — Public surface review closed [0670]

Closed the review under [0665] with one decision record. System and schedule
configuration names now follow their owners; admin/CLI consumer names distinguish
registered consumers from shared consumer-group state. Metric production and
consumption use client handles; OTel integration takes caller-owned pools.
Removed the client datastore accessor, mutable config/logger fields, Owner SQL
helpers, and diagnostic declaration mutation methods/fields. Kept batching,
transactions, migration/destruction scopes, useful option helpers, and worker
metadata inspection with explicit contracts. Retry arithmetic now rejects
unrepresentable budgets and caps backoff before duration conversion.

Targeted race tests, convention/alias checks, library and integration builds,
and affected schema, schema-gate, worker-claim, create-ahead, multi-target, and
producer-batch labs passed during implementation. Diagnostic JSON export was
verified byte-for-byte unchanged. This was not a release or full fresh-DB suite.
Removed the working inventory; ScheduledAt separation, entry-package relocation,
and the broader documentation audit remain separately tracked.

## 2026-09-06 — The payload never reaches a log line or an error [0666]

A review of every log call and raise site closed the two paths a payload
reached logs on. The schedule redeclaration line now reports
`payload_changed` / `metadata_changed` instead of the documents; the produce
and schedule datastores encode the payload in Go and raise VK0097 on failure,
so pgx's `%#v` encode error can no longer print it; the delivery-consumer
dead-letter line drops the handler's error text (it lives in `last_error`).
CONVENTIONS gains the rule under Datastores, Errors, and Logging; the
message-key, idempotency, and dead-letters pages say what does get logged.

## 2026-09-06 — The supported API boundary is explicit [0665]

CONVENTIONS.md and the client guide now identify vulkan and its reachable
exported fields and methods as the supported surface. Other packages remain
importable advanced options without a stability commitment. This replaces
[0507]'s package-demotion plan. ROADMAP and TODO track the current review;
_public-surface.md inventories entry declarations, aliases and their methods,
constants, errors, and events with keep/question/remove recommendations.
The site marks candidate signature changes as Proposed. No signatures or
runtime behavior changed; removal decisions and package relocation remain open.

Conventions tests, edited site pages' Markdown checks, local inventory links,
and diff whitespace checks pass.

## 2026-09-06 — Quickstart defaults use the normal client API [0664]

Retired the DefaultProducer / DefaultConsumer proposal and consolidated the
remaining documentation audit after public surface trim, with comment sweeps
as its execution list. The public roadmap now describes the one-client API.
Public Consume comments and the quickstart explain cancellation and the
explicit opt-out's effect on the embedded manager. Topic Rename and Health
and schedule Destroy now describe their contracts. Runtime behavior is unchanged.

Root build, vulkan package race tests, conventions tests, and Markdown checks
for the edited site pages pass. The broader public API audit remains on ROADMAP.

## 2026-09-05 — Janitor cleanup steps have separate deadlines [0662][0663]

The topic janitor now gives each of its five explicit controller calls a
separate timeout, collects their errors, and stops further steps when the
parent context is canceled. `JanitorConfig.CleanupTimeout` defaults to five
seconds and includes datastore retries. The start log reports the timeout;
the existing tick runner reports the combined errors and applies backoff.
The client guide documents partial progress and the managed fleet's default.

Root build, janitor package race tests, conventions tests, the retention
sweep lab, and the guide's Markdown checks pass. Regression tests exercise
separate deadlines through the controller/retry/pool-acquisition path,
collection of all five timeout errors, and parent cancellation stopping
later steps without opening database connections.

## 2026-09-05 — System registration sets the metrics collector rate [0661]

`RegisterSystemConfig.MetricsCollector.PollRate` now reaches the collector
provisioner's own definition and existing declaration method. Zero keeps
the 30-second default; negative rates are rejected before writes. Repeated
registration updates stored metadata; a running collector adopts it on its
next claim. The client guide documents that timing and the existing logs.

The collector lab now declares its fast rate through the public API and
checks defaults, replacement on the same worker id, and rejection without
changing stored metadata. The lab passes under `-race`, including collection
and the manager's HTTP scrape. Root build, targeted package race tests, and
the conventions tests pass.

## 2026-09-05 — Missing compaction heads are lockable [0659][0660]

`Topic[Message](name).Key(messageKey).LockCompactionHead(ctx, tx)` now gives a
read-modify-write a row lock even before the key has a first compacted message.
The key handle owns both head reads, and the producer instance no longer
exposes `GetCompactionHeadInTx`. One `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE ...
RETURNING` statement creates or locks the row and returns its nullable head.

The compaction-head baseline now makes its three head fields all-null or
all-present and records `created_at` and `updated_at`. A positive, one-hour
`EmptyCompactionHeadTTL` bounds lock-only rows; the existing topic janitor
sweeps expired rows in bounded `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` batches through a
partial index. Materialized heads never expire through this path. Topic
snapshots report the lock-only row count and oldest age without changing the
meaning of `Compacted`.

Scenario 05 uses the key-handle transaction shape, and the new
`compactionheadlocklab` proves two absent-key updates compose, ordinary produce
fills a lock-only row, TTL cleanup is bounded, and both locker-first and
janitor-first races converge. The client guide, table design, config and error
references now describe the shipped behavior. Green at closeout: 50/50 labs on
a recreated database, `just verify`, targeted Prettier/Remark/Vale, the website
build, and `git diff --check`.

## 2026-09-05 — Built-in alert config names what it configures [0658]

`RegisterSystemConfig` now exposes `PartitionCountAlert`,
`CompactionReadCostAlert`, and `WorkerLivenessAlert`. Their public types use the
matching `*AlertConfig` names, and `ScheduleExpression` replaces the ambiguous
`Expression` field. The flat shape remains, so each built-in alert stays
directly discoverable from the system registration config.

The alert lab, playground scenario 13, client aliases, validation paths, and
quickstart use the new names. `just verify`, targeted alert/admin/client race
tests, the website build, and `git diff --check` pass.

## 2026-09-05 — The datastore holds Logger and Retry once [0657]

`PostgresDatastore` now carries `Logger` and `Retry`, filled once from
`ClientConfig` through `PostgresDatastoreConfig`, which binds the
`schema` log attribute where `Schema` is known. No config below the
client declares either: `ConsumerConfig`, `ProducerConfig`, and
`SchedulerConfig` lost their two fields with the facade otherwise
unchanged, `BatcherConfig` lost its logger, `MessageAdminConfig` is
`{AllowDestroy}`, and `pkg/metrics/producer`'s `ProducerConfig` became
`MetricsProducerConfig`. The 41 configs that held only the pair -- every
`ControllerConfig` and `*DatastoreConfig`, the alert controller's, the
base provisioner's -- are deleted with their constructor param; the 19
mixed configs keep their per-loop retry curves.

`Retry` is read from `ds` everywhere. `Logger` is threaded: the reclaim,
dead-letter, and kill-backstop Warns are emitted by datastores and the
worker controller, so every controller, datastore, provisioner, and
runner takes a trailing `logger` -- the owning instance's, or `ds.Logger`
from a caller with no window -- and stays in that instance's suppression
window. The batcher and metrics producer take their producer or consumer
instance's logger for the same reason; the scheduler instance holds none.
A nested producer or consumer instance registered by a worker logs as
itself. CONVENTIONS ## Constructors & configs states the rule.

The root cause was a naming collision, not the pair itself: [0653] gave
the bare noun `Consumer` to the resource, so the assembler's config had
no name left. Renaming the assembler (`Assembler`, `Registrar`,
`Factory`, `Provisioner`) and renaming the resource back were both
rejected; holding the pair on the datastore every constructor already
takes needed neither.

Green on a fresh database: 49/49 labs (`metrics-collector-lab` run by
hand -- its recipe's `go build -o bin/vulkan cmd/vulkan` cannot see the
nested CLI module from the root, a pre-existing recipe fault), `just
verify` (165 tests, 80 packages, race), `just compat-lab` round-trip,
tools/conventions, and the website chain (eslint through Playwright)
after `prettier --check`, which fails on a pre-existing `sql.test.ts`
drift.

## 2026-09-05 — Visitor utility pages stay outside search results [0656]

`/search/` and `/whats-new/` now share one search-engine indexing policy. The
shared layout emits `noindex` for those routes, and Astro's sitemap integration
uses the same policy to omit them from generated sitemap entries. Ordinary
documentation remains indexable, with no meta-keyword or thin tag-archive
surface added.

The path-policy unit test, targeted Vitest and Prettier checks, ESLint, Astro
check, the website build, and a focused Playwright flow in Chromium, Firefox,
and WebKit pass. Generated output confirms both utility pages carry `noindex`,
ordinary docs do not, and the sitemap contains no utility or tag paths.

## 2026-09-05 — Code-page search snippets come from their facts [0655]

All 96 error, event, metric, and alert pages now derive their meta description
from the same `CodeThreadData` used by the visible facts panel. Each description
names the code, classification, and consequence; an error with a declared fix
appends it. Code-page frontmatter still carries no separate description, and a
collection test now enforces that boundary.

Verified representative generated metadata for VK0005, VK0041, VK0067, and
VK0094, and confirmed all 96 generated code pages carry the derived shape.
Targeted Vitest and Prettier checks, ESLint, Astro check, the website build,
the decision convention test, and `git diff --check` pass.

## 2026-09-05 — Every doc-site result title carries the site name [0654]

The shared Astro layout now renders every HTML document title as
`<page title> | Vulkan Docs`. Its original page-title prop still reaches the
visible page components unchanged, so headings and breadcrumb labels keep
their authored text.

Verified with the website build, targeted Prettier, ESLint, and Astro checks,
and a focused Playwright flow in Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit that asserts
both `Quickstart | Vulkan Docs` in the document head and `Quickstart` in the
visible H1. `git diff --check` passes.

## 2026-09-05 — The public consuming handles are Consumer-named [0653]

The typed topic tree now selects a consumer group with
`Topic[T](name).Consumer(groupName)` and lists its materialized values with
`Consumers(ctx)`. `ConsumerHandle`, `ConsumerMetricsHandle`, and
`ConsumerAlertsHandle` replace their Group-named forms; `Get` returns the bare
`Consumer` value declared in `pkg/consume`. Every current doc-site sample,
playground, phase-one example, benchmark driver, CLI caller, and facade test
uses the same names.

Consumer group remains the mechanism's name in controller and datastore verbs,
SQL, diagnostics, owner kinds, metrics types, CLI commands, and explanatory
prose. Go permits the `Consumer` selector, handle, and materialized value on
the facade, while `pkg/consume.Consumer` and `pkg/consumer.Consumer` remain
separate package declarations, so the rename introduces no collision.

Verified with `just verify`, compilation of every example and the fill-factor
driver, the website build, targeted Prettier, ESLint, Astro, Remark, and Vale
checks, and `git diff --check`.

## 2026-09-05 — The doc site publishes its canonical sitemap [0652]

Astro's official sitemap integration emits the sitemap index and URL file from
the built routes and the existing live-origin configuration. The
visitor-specific search and what's-new pages are excluded, as is Astro's 404
route. A statically rendered `robots.txt` allows search crawling and advertises
the sitemap without duplicating the route registry.

The deployed index and URL file return 200 as XML. The index names the one URL
file; that file holds 526 unique URLs, all on the canonical origin, with no
excluded routes. The homepage, quickstart, VK0005, and [0652] each return 200.
The live `robots.txt` returns the origin rules without Cloudflare's former
policy-only fallback: managed robots is not enabled, and that fallback had
defined content signals without expressing a crawl preference. Search-engine
submission remains a separate Next item.

Verified locally with the website build, lint, Astro check, Prettier, XML
validation, and `git diff --check`; then verified against the deployed files.

## 2026-09-05 — Documentation links related mechanisms in context [0651]

The website content rules now require a contextual link when another thread
owns a prerequisite, the detailed mechanism, or a relevant contrast. The link
sits at the first useful mention and its anchor names what the reader will
find. Relevance stays an editorial judgment: there is no quota, generated
related-thread box, or mechanically added link.

Documentation-only; no build checks run.

## 2026-09-05 — The CLI reads the migration version through the client [0650]

`client.System().MigrationVersion(ctx)` and
`client.Topic[T](name).MigrationVersion(ctx)` return the version a scope's
tables are at, composed in admin as `SystemMigrationVersion` /
`TopicMigrationVersion` over the owner resolvers [0649] added. The CLI's
`migrate status` and the six `migrate <scope> up|down` leaves read every
current version through those verbs: `migrateTarget` holds a name and a
version, `gatherTargets` takes only the client, and the two
`common.NewTopicOwner` compositions from `GetTopic` rows are gone. `migrate
status` builds no migrate controller; the advisory-lock pre-flight still
does, from `client.Datastore()`. The client guide's sample and old-verbs
table and the migrations guide name the reads.

Verified with the verify chain. No migration; the compatibility table is
unchanged.

## 2026-09-05 — Alerts are first-class resources on the client [0649]

`System().Alerts()`, `Topic(...).Alerts()`, and `Topic(...).Group(...).Alerts()`
are no-I/O scope handles with the metrics grammar: `Definitions()` lists the
scope's built-ins, `Latest` lists the current alert per (name, owner), and
`Alert(name)` names one alert with the owner bound by the tree. The three
built-ins are all topic-owned, so the topic handle carries the typed
selectors `PartitionCount`, `CompactionReadCost`, `WorkerLiveness`. Each
selector returns one `AlertHandle`: `Latest` is the current alert or
`(nil, nil)`, `History` is retained alerts newest first, both bare `*Alert`.
`Alert.At` is the observation time. The message key stays
`<name>/<owner-kind>/<owner-id>`; verbs resolve names to ids when called
through admin's new `SystemOwner` / `TopicOwner` / `GroupOwner`, which also
replaced five inline copies of that lookup, so a destroyed owner reads as
not-found. `SystemHandle.Alerts(ctx)`, `SystemHandle.Alert(messageKey)`, and
every `MessageKey()` handle accessor are gone.

Built-in alerts are declared once: `DiagnosticAlert` is the registry's
fourth kind, `pkg/alert/alerts.go` holds VK0094-VK0096 (the name consts left
the check controllers), `AlertDefinition` is the defensive view, and the
checks build name and severity from the declaration. `vulkan explain`, the
code export, the conventions walks, and three docs pages carry the kind.
The CLI gained `alert list --topic/--group` and `alert get`.

Verified with the verify chain and the full fresh-DB suite (49/49), the
latter run in two halves around a justfile deletion mid-run. No migration;
the compatibility table is unchanged.

## 2026-09-05 — Metrics are first-class resources on the client [0647][0648]

`System().Metrics()`, `Topic(...).Metrics()`, and
`Topic(...).Group(...).Metrics()` are no-I/O resource handles. System lists
every built-in definition and every newest retained series; Topic and Group
compute live `Snapshot` values and expose typed built-in selectors. Each
selector returns one `MetricHandle`: `Latest` reads its newest retained
`Measurement`, `History` reads retained measurements newest first, and both
drop the storage envelope. `Measurement.At` keeps collected state visibly
different from live state. The System handle's `Metric(name, attributes)` is
the one arbitrary escape for user-produced and dynamically selected series.

The existing diagnostic registry is the catalog. `DiagnosticMetric` now owns
strongly typed scope and ordered attribute keys, `MetricDefinition` is its
defensive public view, and every built-in producer constructs measurements
from its declaration. The collector gauges are declared beside worker,
schedule, alert, topic, consumer-group, and consumer-session metrics under
VK0067-VK0093; those declarations also drive selectors, `vulkan explain`, the
code pages, and Prometheus help. Retained reads reuse compaction heads and
message history; live reads reuse the metrics snapshots, with no metric SQL
added. The CLI and metrics examples use the same public handle tree.

Verified with `just verify`, the metrics and alert labs, and the full fresh-DB
suite (49/49). `just compat-lab` passed its documented working-tree round-trip
dry run; there is no prior release tag to pin yet. This work adds no migration,
so the pre-1.0 compatibility-table row is unchanged.

## 2026-09-04 — The topic handle carries the message type, a message key is a handle under it [0646]

`client.Topic[Message](name)` roots the typed tree: the group's
`Register` (was `client.Consumer`; `ConsumerHandle` deleted), the
producer's `Register` (was `client.Producer`), the new
`Key(k).CompactionHead` / `Key(k).Messages` reads, and
`CompactionHeads` all inherit the type and take none of their own; the
admin verbs ignore it. `CompactionHead` raises VK0066 (new
`pkg/compaction/errors.go`, docs page, CLI fix); `AlertHandle.Get` and
`MeasurementHandle.Get` are one-liners over the key handle. Callers
with no message type in scope, the CLI and admin-only scripts, pass
`common.RawPayload`, the stored JSON bytes at version 0: a consumer
cannot register with it and a produce with it is refused at the value
(the datastore's `checkSchemaVersion` after `produceFunc`, the batch
preamble), since `ScheduleStoredMessage` carries its version by value
and a type-level producer guard broke the schedule producer. Naming:
every type parameter is `Message`, so the stored-row read-model
`common.Message` became `StoredMessage[Message]` (JSON unchanged) and
the schedule root took its prefix (`ScheduleStoredMessage`,
`ScheduleMessageOutcome` and consts); schedules stay system-rooted on
`client.Scheduler(name)`, their `Register` type inferred from the
payload. CLI: `vulkan topic key get <topic> <key>` and `vulkan topic
key messages <topic> <key> --limit`, payload printed as stored JSON.
Docs: the client guide, quickstart, replay, schema-versions,
new-group-start, schedules, consumer-group-config, lifecycle, fan-out,
routing, and the playground scenarios spell the tree; `message_key`
joined the attribute registry. Verified: `just verify`, ten
directly-affected labs during the build, and the fresh-DB suite
ran 49/49 at close-out. Carried the Register-verb half of the ROADMAP item
"Register returns what you run, the client holds the assemblers"; the
config split stays in ROADMAP Now. Deferred: a head read at a
mismatched schema version (ROADMAP Later, beside the upcaster).

## 2026-09-03 — Binding handle under the group, client lists are bare plurals [0645]

`client.Topic(t).Group(g).Binding().Get(ctx)` reads one group's effective
binding set, nil when the group never declared one; the fleet listing is
`System().Bindings`. The read-model is `Binding` (was
`BindingDeclaration`) all the way down, the `<Noun>Declaration` suffix
left CONVENTIONS with it, and the client's four `List*` verbs became
`Workers`, `Messages`, `KeyMessages`, `Bindings`. The datastore's
`BindingLog*` names caught up with the [0611] table rename as
`BindingConfigLog*`. CLI: `vulkan group binding list` and `vulkan group
binding get <topic> <group>` replace `alert bindings`. Lab: bindinglab
drives `Binding().Get` through install, wait, swap, and the absent-group
nil; the fresh-DB suite ran 49/49 at close-out. `Waiting`, `Log`,
`Matches` wait in ROADMAP Later.

## 2026-09-03 — One declaration per type, vulkan as the client plus aliases [0643]

Every user-spelled type, const, declared error, and declared event is now
declared exactly once, in the lowest package that reads it, and `pkg/vulkan`
is the client plus aliases: `Client`, `ClientConfig`, the pool, the four
handles, the two instance wrappers, and the `Producer`/`Consumer`
interfaces are its own; every other exported name is an alias or var into
the declaring package, so a click-through lands on the declaration in one
hop instead of four. The alias set is computed, not kept -- a go/types walk
in tools/conventions type-checks `pkg/vulkan` from source, follows every
exported signature, field, method, and type parameter, and requires an
alias or var whose target is the reached object under its own name; the
same walk enforces the machinery floor (a controller, datastore, batcher,
or worker package declares nothing a user spells beyond its Config, `*Row`,
and controller/datastore/instance/provisioner types). This reverses the
ROADMAP item that had declarations moving into `vulkan`: Go's import graph
forbids the package that declares the types from importing the machinery
that reads them, so River's facade-plus-types shape won over
Temporal's alias-into-internal.

The tree moved to match the laws. `consumergroup` is `consume` and
producer's controller and batcher are `produce/...`, so activity roots
carry the verb and their assemblers the agent noun (consume/consumer,
produce/producer, schedule/scheduler); the roots' own controllers are
`ConsumeController` and `ProduceController`. `Versioned` and
`SchemaVersionOf` live in `common` (five domains read them); `Tx`,
`TransactionFunc`, and `InTransaction` live in `pkg/datastore`; the
declaration inputs a controller consumes -- `TopicConfig`,
`ScheduleConfig`, `ScheduleSpec`, `SystemConfig`, the three alert
`*JobConfig` types -- live in their roots, and the schedule controller
parses `spec.Cron` itself. `ConsumerConfig` gained `Bindings`; admin
gained `GetGroup`, `ListGroups`, `ListGroupWorkers`, `GetCompactionHead`,
and `ListKeyMessages` so every handle verb is one call; vulkan's adapter
and three config twins are deleted, and `RegisterProducer` /
`RegisterConsumer` fill a nil `Logger` and `Retry` from the client. Codes
follow the same law with no assembler case: the seven declared below or
beside a root (VK0018, VK0033, VK0038, VK0041, VK0053, VK0056, VK0057,
VK0065) moved to `produce`, `migrate`, `consume`, and `system` under
exported names, every root's `logs.go` is `events.go`, and generic-noun
types took their root's prefix at the declaration -- `MetricKind`,
`MetricUnit`, `AlertStatus`, `AlertSeverity`, `ScheduleExpression`, and
the `DiagnosticError` / `DiagnosticEvent` / `DiagnosticQuery` /
`DiagnosticMetric` set with `NewDiagnostic*` constructors,
`RecoveryTransient` / `RecoveryPermanent`, `DiagnosticKind*` -- so the
flat vulkan namespace never collides.

Six tools/conventions tests hold the shape: alias declarations only in
alias.go, no `/controller` import from vulkan, the closure walk comparing
targets, the machinery floor over the same closure, every
`NewDiagnostic*` call initializing an exported var in a root's
errors.go / events.go / metrics.go (doubling as the registry-completeness
check, whose regex had gone dead in the rename), and SQL owner segments
naming their datastore (which caught `consumerbase`, now `consumebase`).
The docs pass moved `handler-outcomes`, VK0054, VK0055, and the three
`RegisterSchedule` samples to vulkan's spellings. Verified: `just verify`
green and the fresh-DB lab suite 49/49 on 2026-09-03. [0643] amends
[0625]'s "every user type in vulkan" clause and [0555]'s package kinds.

## 2026-09-02 — Consume runs the deployment's upkeep [0638]-[0642]

A deployment no longer needs to know the system manager exists. `Consume`
runs it beside the session, so one live consumer keeps the fleet-wide
workers running for every topic in the deployment; `ClientConfig.DisableManager`
is the per-process opt-out, for consumer pods beside a dedicated
`vulkan manager run` and for consumers under a database role with no DDL
rights. The composition lives in `pkg/vulkan`: `ConsumerInstance` stops
being an alias of the consumer package's type and becomes a struct
embedding it, running the session and `manager.Run` in an errgroup [0642].
`pkg/consumer` learns nothing -- the func field on its config that [0638]
first routed this through was rejected on review, since a config holds
static values and never a runnable, and building the manager inside
`pkg/consumer` is an import cycle (the alert packages import it; the
system manager assembles the alerts).

What made it safe is that the manager stopped being the one worker exempt
from the system's own claim gate. Its row is declared
`target_instances = 1` [0638], so N reconcile loops across N processes
arbitrate the way every other worker already does: one claim wins, the
rest retry on `RetryDelay` and take over when the holder stops. The
column is the deployment's runtime dial with no code -- 0 suspends upkeep
everywhere (VK0035), 1 is the default, N runs N copies, -1 restores
every-process behavior. Declaring the target exposed a hole [0549] left:
`TargetInstances` arrived by mutating a built `Definition`, so
`worker.InstanceTarget` became a named type and a required
`NewDefinition`/`NewManagerProvisioner` parameter, and both post-construction
pokes are gone [0639].

`SystemManager.Run` lost its permit and refuses nothing. [0638] first made
it join-and-block over a caller count; review found the count had no users
-- the scheduler builds a manager per `Schedule` call, `RunManager` is
called once everywhere, and several `Consume`s on one client are exactly
what the row arbitrates -- so `Run` is now a per-caller loop and the row is
the only arbiter [0641]. A life that ends on its own logs the declared
VK0065 and claims again behind `SystemManagerConfig.RunRetry` [0640],
because with a shared loop nothing returns to a `Consume` by design: no
restart would have left one fatal killing a process's upkeep for its
lifetime, and `vulkan manager run` up doing nothing.

Verified on a fresh database: the 49-lab suite is green, and the manager row
comes up at 1 on a new volume where the old one still held -1.

Playground scenarios 08, 12, and 13 dropped their hand-wired
`RunManager` (08 is now scenario 03's shape, and 13 no longer needs an
errgroup at all); `schedulepermitlab` -- which asserted the deleted
refusal -- became `scheduleconcurrencylab`; `managerautorunlab` is the new
proof, green on all five phases. One upgrade note: re-declaration updates
only a worker row's metadata, so an installation created before the gate
still carries `target_instances = -1` on its manager row and needs a
drop+recreate of its schema to pick up the 1.

## 2026-09-02 — ProduceInTx takes the message [0634]

The produce surface is four verbs, one per cell of {value, closure} ×
{Vulkan's transaction, the caller's}: `Produce`, `ProduceFunc`,
`ProduceInTx`, `ProduceFuncInTx`. `ProduceInTx(ctx, tx, message, options)`
takes the message now; the closure form it replaced kept its whole body
under the new name `ProduceFuncInTx`. A `ProducerFunc` is
`func(ctx context.Context, tx Tx) (*Message, error)` -- the third
`idempotencyKey` argument is gone, because since [0622] a caller who needs
the key supplies it through `ProduceOptions.IdempotencyKey`.

What a caller gets is a multi-topic `InTransaction` block that reads as a
statement per topic instead of a closure per topic. Playground scenario 02
was the instrument that measured the gap, and both of its "traps hit" lines
were this: a closure spelling `_` for a parameter nobody used, and a static
payload that still cost a closure. Both lines are deleted. The scenario's
concept count stays at 8 -- its single-topic `ProduceFunc` still holds
`ProducerFunc` and `vulkan.Tx`.

The passthrough closures the old shape forced went with it. The schedule
producer built one per due row to hand `ProduceInTx` a stored message, and
passes the value straight through now. Across the labs 43 closure
signatures dropped the unused parameter, and two assertions in
idempotencykeyslab were deleted rather than adapted -- both checked that
the closure received the key, a fact the caller now owns.
`autoGeneratedKeyScenario` proves the same thing better from the database:
three unkeyed calls leave three claim rows.

multitargetlab is the one program exercising both caller-owned-transaction
verbs. Eight of its nine produces take the value; its rollback scenario
keeps a closure through `ProduceFuncInTx`, because the error that closure
returns is the whole point of the scenario and a value cannot carry one.

The transactional-produce guide was rewritten first and reviewed before any
Go changed, the way [0633]'s page was. It leads with the four-verb table,
shows the multi-topic block as one statement per topic, and gained the
compacted-key deadlock-ordering rule that until now lived only in
`ProduceInTx`'s Go doc comment.

Scenario 02 also stopped depending on a table nobody created: it wrote to
`playground_orders` and never made it, so the scenario could not run
against a fresh database at all -- a gap that predated this work. It owns
the table now, through a `createOrdersTable` call at the top of `run()`.

Fresh-DB suite at the checkpoint: 47/47 labs. The four short-lived
playground scenarios (01, 02, 05, 09) pass; the nine that run until
interrupted were not scored.

## 2026-09-02 — the pool builder is client-package API [0637]

`NewPostgresPool` and `PostgresConnectionConfig` moved from
`pkg/datastore` to `pkg/vulkan`. The signature did not change and neither
did the division of labour -- the builder assembles, `NewClient` pings --
but the quickstart's first program now imports `vulkan` and nothing else
of ours.

[0636] took the datastore concept off the doc site; it did not take the
package name. The builder makes a `*pgxpool.Pool` out of five strings and
never touches a datastore, so a program using it imported `datastore` for
a function that had nothing to do with one, and the samples that avoided
it imported `pgxpool` instead. Two packages to get one pool, either way.

The doc site leads with `NewPostgresPool` now. `pgxpool.New(ctx, dsn)` is
one paragraph down as the path for a `DATABASE_URL` deployment and for an
application whose pool predates Vulkan -- `NewClient` takes any
`*pgxpool.Pool`, so nothing about that path changed.

31 of the 77 programs in the repo dropped the `datastore` import outright,
the thirteen playground scenarios among them. The 46 that keep it hold a
`*PostgresDatastore` to drive controllers directly, which is what the
package is for. `pkg/datastore` keeps `PostgresDatastore`,
`PostgresDatastoreConfig`, and `Querier` -- the seam every domain imports,
and no longer something a user's import block names.

## 2026-09-02 — the client takes the pool [0636]

`vulkan.NewClient(ctx, pool, cfg)` builds the datastore itself. Setting
Vulkan up is two steps now -- build a pool, hand it to the client -- and
`PostgresDatastore` has left the user's path: the quickstart's first
program imports `pgxpool` and `vulkan`, nothing else.

The middle step carried no decision. `PostgresDatastore` is `{Pool,
Schema}`, and 73 of the 75 places in this repo that built one did it to
pass it straight to `NewClient`. The thirteen playground scenarios did it
identically, and scenario 01's header already charged it against the API
as a concept held before any domain code; every scenario's count falls by
one.

`ClientConfig` gains `Schema`, passed through to
`PostgresDatastoreConfig`, which stays the one owner of the `vulkan`
default and the lowercase-identifier rule. `Client.Datastore()` hands the
built handle back for the paths the client's verbs do not cover --
`otelvulkan.NewExporter`, a lab driving controllers directly. That
accessor is what makes the fold safe rather than only shorter: with the
client owning the schema, a caller building a second datastore beside it
could set a different one, and `schemalab` and the CLI both passed a
schema in two places before this.

`vulkan.InTransaction(ctx, ds, fn)` became the method
`client.InTransaction(ctx, fn)`. Left free it would have made the
transactional-produce sample read `vulkan.InTransaction(ctx,
client.Datastore(), fn)` -- the datastore back in the user's face, in the
sample where it stood out most.

The CLI collapsed to one connection helper. `openDatastore` is gone,
`openClient` returns `(client, close, err)`, and it takes the log level
its caller wants: ERROR for the twenty-two one-shot commands, whose own
✓/error output is the interface, and INFO for `manager run`, whose log
stream is its output.

`NewClient` takes a `ctx` and performs I/O now -- the construction ping
moved inside it, so the old "wraps ds, it does not connect" contract is
gone, and one constructor verifies connectivity where two did.
`NewPostgresDatastore` stays exported for the programs that work at that
layer: `tools/compat` and the dozen labs whose scenarios drive
controllers directly.

## 2026-09-02 — the datastore takes the caller's pool [0633]

`NewPostgresDatastore(ctx, pool, cfg)` wraps a `*pgxpool.Pool` you built
and pings it once; it no longer assembles one from user/host/database
parts. `NewPostgresPool(ctx, user, password, host, database, cfg)` is the
guided builder beside it, its parameters the DSN exploded in the order the
URL writes them, and anyone holding a DSN calls `pgxpool.New` directly.
`PostgresDatastore.Close` is gone -- whoever built the pool closes it, so
75 call sites became `defer pool.Close()`. The config split in two:
`PostgresDatastoreConfig` holds `Schema` alone, and
`PostgresConnectionConfig` keeps only what a connection actually needs
(`Port`, `MaxConns`, `ConnectTimeout`, `TLSConfig`).

The old signature split the credential pair -- `user` inline, `Pass` in
the config, reading as though a password were optional tuning next to
`MaxConns` -- and re-spelled four knobs pgx already parses. What it could
not do at all was accept the pool an application already runs, which is
most applications, and a `DATABASE_URL` deployment had no path.

Rebuilding the DSN turned up a real bug in the old one:
`fmt.Sprintf("postgres://%s:%s@%s:%s/%s", ...)` silently corrupts any
password holding `@`, `:`, `/`, or `#`, and produces a broken authority
for an IPv6 host. It goes through `net/url` and `net.JoinHostPort` now,
with a table test round-tripping four cases back through
`pgxpool.ParseConfig`.

The CLI shrank by ~90 lines. `parseConnConfig` and its helpers existed
only because "pkg/datastore has no URL constructor today", and handing the
DSN to pgx made the command strictly more capable: `sslmode` works, where
the old parser printed a warning saying it could not honour it, and so do
keyword/value DSNs and the libpq `PG*` environment variables. The
usage-versus-operational split survives -- a parse failure is a usage
error, dialing is not, and `--schema` is validated before the pool is
built -- as does the `search_path` guard, now reading pgx's own
`RuntimeParams` rather than re-parsing the URL.

Two things moved that the record did not anticipate. Every playground
scenario header gained a concept, since the pool is one more thing held
before domain code: the two base scorecards went 5 -> 6 and 7 -> 8 and the
eleven derived counts followed. And reporting a caller-built pool's
ceiling on the manager's start line, which [0633] listed as the home for
the `MaxConns` warning, was built and then dropped -- threading the value
through the provisioner into the instance to print one attribute was not
worth it, so the warning stays on the config field.

Verified fresh-DB 47/47 with `just verify` green across all seven modules.
The CLI's rewritten connection path was driven by hand for what no lab
covers: a wrong scheme and a DSN carrying `search_path` still fail as
usage errors, while `sslmode=disable` and the keyword/value form now work.

## 2026-09-01 — every SQL literal names its schema [0631][0632]

`search_path` is gone. Every table reference in production SQL is
`%[1]s.<name>` -- the schema is Sprintf verb `[1]`, filled from the
datastore's own `Schema`, tables following as `[2]`, `[3]` -- so the schema
repeats at every reference rather than being passed N times (23 of them in
`deliveryconsumer.fanOut`). Plain `fmt.Sprintf` and no helper: `go vet`
only checks verbs against args when the format string reaches Sprintf
unmodified, and a `Fill` wrapper was built and reverted for exactly that.
298 references across 208 literals and 53 files.

This supersedes [0630]'s "no SQL changes" clause, whose premise counted 207
literals each becoming a Sprintf when 114 already were one. The hazard it
left was real, not theoretical: with the path set to `"<schema>, public"`,
any table missing from the installation's own schema resolved to public's
copy -- a neighbour's rows on a read, and its table on a
`DROP TABLE IF EXISTS` during a destroy retry. Two installations in one
database is what [0630] blessed, and topic ids are per-installation
serials, so the names collide by construction.

Names that reach Postgres outside a literal are qualified in Go instead:
four `to_regclass($1)` bind parameters and the janitor's `'%s'::regclass`.
Index names stay bare (an index lands in its table's schema), and so does
`REPLACE(c.relname, ...)` -- `pg_class.relname` is unqualified, so the
prefix stripped from it must be too. Five free funcs with no receiver took
a trailing `schema string`.

With every literal naming its schema, the path had one job left: a post-v1
migration step reaches no datastore, so its SQL would still have resolved
through it. `migrate.Migration`'s four func fields took
`(ctx, q, schema string, topicId int64)` -- free while both registries are
empty and impossible once a step ships -- and the pool then stopped setting
`search_path` at all [0632]. That removed the wart [0630] had accepted: a
caller's own `CREATE TABLE` inside `InTransaction` now lands in the
caller's schema, not Vulkan's. Absence still reads as absence, because a
read through a missing schema raises 42P01 and only a write raises 3F000.

Demonstrated rather than argued. schemalab stands a whole installation in
`public` -- the schema every `search_path` ends with -- and asserts an
unregistered schema still reads the `(nil, nil)` absence; sabotaging
`topic.get` back to an unqualified `FROM topic_config` leaves the original
assertions passing and fails the new one with `got schemalab.orders`. A
second section asserts the `InTransaction` CREATE lands outside Vulkan's
schema, and fails with the path restored.

Four verification layers, because each is blind where the next sees:
`sql_schema_test.go` walks every `-- vulkan:` literal through the Go AST
and splits on the dot rather than testing a prefix (a prefix test passes
double qualification -- four literals had it, and the user caught them
before the walk existed); `go vet` catches arity but not a wrong-but-valid
index; only the fresh-DB suite executes the statements. Task 3 silently
killed `TestTableNamesEndInAKnownKind` on the way -- it skipped any name
containing `%`, so all 13 shared tables fell out of the kind check and it
passed while walking nothing. Both directions sabotaged. `tools/` is its
own module reading library source as data, so these runs need `-count=1`
to mean anything.

The labs came along, closing the gap [0628] opened when it removed
CONVENTIONS' lab exception without updating the labs: 217 per-topic sites
now call `topic.*Table()` and carry the schema, 51 shared-table references
are qualified, and the 62 display strings stay bare because they name a
table for a human. The blanket sweep broke 8 labs, all one mistake --
flattening the distinction the production pass had gotten right. The bare
name is required where it meets `pg_class`/`pg_stat_user_tables.relname`,
EXPLAIN output (which prints partition names unqualified), or
`ALTER TABLE ... RENAME TO`, which Postgres refuses to qualify.

The sandbox's 45 SQL mirrors re-synced byte-exact; `interpolate` reads
indexed verbs and fills `[1]` with PGlite's own `public`, so no call site
passes a schema. Both `statements.ts` files now hold the raw templates and
the filled statements side by side, since one array had been serving the
drift test and the runtime at once and the raw form is no longer runnable
-- `npm run verify` caught that as a real prerender failure
(`syntax error at or near "%"`), now guarded structurally.

Green on a fresh database: 47/47 labs, `just verify`, `just compat-lab`,
24 conventions tests, `npm run verify` (vale 0 errors across 94 files,
vitest 114, Playwright 18 across three engines).

## 2026-09-01 — seams, the schema, and per-installation locks [0628]-[0630]

Chunk 15, the last of the one-client queue. `vulkan.Producer[Message]`
and `vulkan.Consumer[Message]` publish each typed instance's WHOLE public
surface -- five methods and one -- so a service can hold the interface and
a test can supply its own; a curated subset would be a second definition
of what a producer is. The compile-time assertions live in
`tools/conventions`, not in the user-facing package.

`internal/topic/tables.go` became `pkg/topic/tables.go` and the
table-name funcs are public API [0628], superseding [0371]: its premise
("zero example programs call them") had already failed for labs, which
cannot import `internal/`, and fails again for an operator pasting a
diagnose query. The repo-root `internal/` is gone.

"Schema" had three senses and was about to gain a fourth, so the migration
one moved [0629]: `migrate status` reports `system` as an object beside a
`topics` array in both output modes, the result documents dropped `scope`,
and VK0017 became "system not registered". That fixed a real ambiguity --
only the `__system.` PREFIX is reserved, so a topic named `system` printed
two indistinguishable rows. "Schema version" for a MIGRATION version is
deliberately left alone, parked in ROADMAP with the rule for taking it up.

A Postgres schema is now one Vulkan installation [0630].
`PostgresConnectionConfig.Schema` (default `vulkan`) sets the pool's
`search_path` to `"<schema>, public"` -- `public` trails so a caller's own
tables stay visible inside `InTransaction` -- and no SQL is qualified,
which would have turned 207 literals into Sprintf calls. `RegisterSystem`
runs `CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS` first; 42501 raises VK0064.
`DestroySystem` leaves the schema standing. This makes `system_config`'s
singleton row correct permanently, answering [0625]'s open question.

All six advisory lock keys took the schema. `common.AdvisoryLock`, one
constant shared by system register, system delete, and migrate, became
`common.NewAdvisoryLockKey(kind, schema, parts...)` -- vulkan's namespace
(ASCII "VULK") in the high 32 bits, a crc32 of the name in the low 32,
with `Value`/`ClassId`/`ObjId` giving the halves `pg_locks` files it
under. Three `hashtext` expressions and `advisoryLockKey`'s bit-packer
went with it, and so did that packer's 2^20 partitions-per-topic ceiling.
None of it was a correctness fix -- `search_path` already isolates the
tables -- but two installations no longer serialize on locks neither
needs. The keys are derived, so across the deploy that ships this an older
process and a newer one take different keys and do not serialize on
RegisterSystem or migrate up.

The schema reached the operator. All 37 declared diagnose queries qualify
every table they name with `{schema}`, enforced by a `tools/conventions`
walk; the client binds `schema` once onto its logger so every line names
the installation the reader must substitute. The CLI took `--schema` and
`VULKAN_ADMIN_SCHEMA`, and a `search_path` in the database URL is now a
usage error rather than a silently ignored parameter. Two latent bugs
surfaced on the way: `orderFlags` never cleared `SortFlags` on
`PersistentFlags`, which nothing had caught because two globals sorted
alphabetically into definition order; and `tools/compat` had not compiled
against the working tree since the [0625] API changes, so `just compat-lab`
was failing before it could test anything. It now refuses to run unless its
`search_path` already reaches a migrated schema -- otherwise a pinned build
creates its own empty tables and round-trips against itself.

The site lost PROPOSED. guides/client.mdx and guides/consumer-group-config.mdx
document shipped API; what is still unbuilt (the `Declaration` outcome,
`vulkantest`) is an aside, and every sample was re-checked against
`go doc ./pkg/vulkan`. A schema section landed on the client guide, 43 SQL
references across 14 pages took the `vulkan.` prefix, and the playground
headers were re-scored -- five had drifted to renamed API and four had
arithmetic that never added up.

Green on a fresh database: 47/47 labs, `just verify`, `just compat-lab`,
`npm run verify` (vale 0 errors across 94 files, vitest 107, Playwright
18).

## 2026-09-01 — one client over the datastore [0625][0626][0627]

`vulkan.NewClient(ds, cfg)` is the API. It holds the ambient config once
-- `Logger`, `Retry`, `AllowDestroy` -- so nothing below it carries a
`Logger` or `Retry` field, which removed the worst trap on the old
`ConsumerConfig`: `Retry` beside `Message.Retry`, both `*RetryPolicy`, one
for the datastore and one for redelivery. `NewConsumer`, `NewProducer`,
`NewScheduler`, `NewMessageAdmin`, and `NewSystemManager` became its
assemblers.

Two grammars. The client names the noun (`RegisterConsumer[T]`,
`RegisterTopic`, `ListTopics`, `Topic(name)`); a handle uses the bare verb
(`orders.Rename`, `nightly.Suspend`). Handles cost no I/O and cannot fail,
`Get(ctx)` is the one comma-ok read, and every other verb returns the
not-found error itself. `List<Child>` on every parent added
`Topic.ListGroups` and `Group.ListWorkers`. The key reads moved onto the
topic (`Topic.CompactionHead[T]`, `Topic.ListKeyMessages[T]`), replacing a
separate `CompactionController` keyed by topic id -- two objects for one
fact.

Read-models took `<Noun>Data` and the 63 datastore scan structs became
`<Table>Row`, named for the table they scan. `ScheduleSpec` replaced three
adjacent strings, where a `name`/`topic` swap registered a schedule nobody
would notice was wrong. Every options struct became nil-able.

The group's config split in two: `ConsumerConfig` at `RegisterConsumer` is
what the group means and is stored on its `worker_config` rows;
`ConsumeOptions` at `Consume` is how one process runs. Instances read the
declared document back on a refresh interval instead of each process
writing in its own copy.

Newest wins and nothing refuses [0626]. `RequireMatch` was built and
reverted in full, the stale-build gate was cut before code -- both are a
lock with no key, blocking a config change or a rollback with no verb that
unlocks it. What stands is the differing-overwrite warn, promoted to
declared events: VK0059 (worker), VK0061 (topic), VK0062 (schedule).

The producer-liveness gap became the third built-in alert rather than a
bespoke check [0627]: `pkg/alert/workerliveness`, hourly, over the
`metrics.WorkerUnclaimed` classification the fleet already computes, with
its controller owning no SQL. No threshold -- the manager deletes expired
instance rows every tick, so an unclaimed duration is unreadable, and
`live < target` is wrong for `NoInstanceTarget` group consumers. Its
register-time line is VK0063 for all three built-ins, and an alert's own
clause moved from `message` to `alert_message` at every site.

## 2026-08-30 — the first RegisterTopic stands up the system [0624]

Public `RegisterTopic` now checks for the system row and runs
`RegisterSystem(ctx, nil)` when none exists — register-if-absent, never a
re-declare, so a system registered with custom alert schedules keeps its
declaration. `RegisterSystem` stays public as the cfg path; every other
verb keeps its VK0017 gate. Topic catalog reads map 42P01 to absence, so
a misordered program gets VK0005 instead of a raw undefined-table error.
First boot needed no new locking (`system.register` already serializes
under `pg_advisory_xact_lock`); a probe racing six pools calling bare
RegisterTopic on an empty database converged every round. Quickstart and
six playgrounds lost the RegisterSystem line; scenario 03 lost its whole
admin detour. The labs dropped the boilerplate call too -- only the seven
where RegisterSystem is the subject or no topic gets registered keep it.
Full fresh-DB lab suite 44/44.

## 2026-08-30 — std uuid replaces github.com/google/uuid [0623]

Every import moved to Go 1.27's std `uuid` package; google/uuid left
go.mod, so main-module deps are std + pgx + x/sync. NewV7 error checks
collapsed (std is infallible), `resolveIdempotencyKey` lost its error
return, and the v5 hash it needs is vendored verbatim from google/uuid
v1.6.0 with a provenance header (`producer/controller/uuid_hash.go`),
tested against the RFC 9562 example vector. pgx encodes the std type
natively; wire and storage shapes unchanged.

## 2026-08-30 — IdempotencyKey is a caller string [0622]

`ProduceOptions.IdempotencyKey` went from `uuid.UUID` to `string`: ""
mints a fresh v7 as before, a string that parses as a UUID passes
verbatim, any other string hashes to a deterministic UUIDv5 under a
namespace frozen in producer/controller. `ProduceFunc` closures now
receive the resolved key as a string. Schema untouched; the original
string is never stored. Playground 09 lost its derive-a-UUID trap;
guides and ~35 labs/playgrounds swept. Full fresh-DB lab suite 44/44.

## 2026-08-30 — a schedule is a producer on a cron expression; "cron job" renamed "schedule" [0621]

- Third API handle, the producer/consumer mirror: `scheduler.NewScheduler(ds,
  cfg)` -> `Register[Message](ctx, name, expression, topicName, payload,
  cfg)` -> `*SchedulerInstance[Message]` (`Registered` row, `Payload`) ->
  `Schedule(ctx)`, which builds and runs a system manager per call. The
  system produces the stored payload onto the user's own topic; consumers
  are plain `consumer.Register[T]` groups on it and `scheduled_at` reaches
  the handler as `consumergroup.MessageMeta.ScheduledAt`. The handle is
  the one declaration path -- `MessageAdmin` has no RegisterSchedule, and
  registers the built-in alerts' schedules through its own `Scheduler`.
- `schedule_config.topic_id` is the target topic and `schema_version` is
  stored beside the marshaled `payload`; the producer datastore reads the
  version from the payload value's `SchemaVersion()`, which is what lets
  `schedule.StoredMessage` replay a stored row through `ProduceInTx`.
  Message key = the schedule name, compaction on. Every schedule is the
  system's: the nullable owner pair is gone. Status and message listings
  read the target topic's `delivery_log` by message key; `Register` warns
  VK0058 when the target's DeliveryLogMode keeps no success rows.
  `ScheduleConfig.Metadata` stays as operator annotation.
- The rename: `pkg/cron` -> `pkg/schedule` (`cron.Schedule` ->
  `schedule.Expression`), the worker `pkg/schedule/producer`, tables
  `schedule_config` / `schedule_config_log` / `schedule_cursor` with column
  `expression`, admin `*Schedule` verbs (`ScheduleMessages`), CLI `vulkan
  schedule get|list|run|suspend|unsuspend|destroy` (`get --messages`), log
  keys `schedule` / `schedule_id`, VK0013/VK0025/VK0037 rewordings, the
  CONVENTIONS vocabulary row banning "cron job". `cron.JobRequest` and
  `alertcontroller.ToJobPayload` are deleted; alerts consume
  `alert.JobPayload` from `schedule.TopicName` (`__system.schedules`).
- Every `[Message any]` outside pkg/producer is `[Message
  topic.Versioned]`; `common.MessageRow` keeps `any` (infrastructure
  cannot import the pkg/topic vocabulary root).
- Spec page guides/schedules is shipped behavior (aside off); playground
  06 and schedulelab drive the handle. Full fresh-DB lab suite 44/44.

## 2026-08-30 — partition heal covers the failing row [0620]

- The self-heal creates the partition covering the id sequence's
  `last_value + 1` -- where the rerun's id will land -- instead of
  `MAX(id)+1`, and one `insertUntilCovered` loop reruns the insert at
  once after each heal -- a batch whose ids straddle a boundary heals
  twice -- bounded at one heal plus one per `Retry.MaxRetries`;
  exhaustion is VK0056 (permanent).
  Fixes producerbatchlab's 1-in-4 heal-scenario failure. The heal warn
  is declared as VK0057. Create-ahead
  creates the partition after the trigger id; no `MAX(id)` read.

## 2026-08-30 — the type argument moves to Register [0619]

- `producer.NewProducer(ds, cfg)` and `consumer.NewConsumer(ds, cfg)`
  take no type argument; `Register[Message]` is a Go 1.27 generic
  method on each, so one handle registers every type the process
  emits or reads. The metrics producer and the alert provisioners
  drop their second producer field; MessageAdmin its second
  compaction controller.
- `ProducerController`, `ProducerDatastore`, and `CompactionController`
  are plain structs with generic methods -- none held Message-typed
  state -- built once in `NewProducer` / the owning constructor.
  `AppendMessage[Message]` reads `topic.SchemaVersionOf` itself; the
  controller's `schemaVersion` field and param are gone.
- Every go.mod and go.work is `go 1.27.0`; the quickstart says Go
  1.27+. All 63 examples and the doc-site samples rewritten.

## 2026-08-30 — schema version moves onto the message row [0618]

- `message_log_<id>.schema_version` is written from the Message type's
  own `SchemaVersion() int` (`topic.Versioned` constrains `NewProducer` /
  `NewConsumer`; `topic.SchemaVersionOf` reads it; the `topic.SchemaVersion`
  type is gone); `topic_config` is
  `UNIQUE (name)`. `RegisterTopic` / `GetTopic` / `DestroyTopic` /
  `Producer.Register` / `Consumer.Register` / `GetGroup` /
  `DestroyGroup` / `TopicMetrics` / `MigrateTopic` and the CLI's
  `--schema-version` flag drop the version; `RenameTopic` returns one
  topic.
- A group claims only rows at its type's version -- the predicate sits
  beside the binding predicate in readMessages, fanOut, and the
  exception claim (EXISTS on message_log), so a dead-lettered v1 row
  never replays into a v2 struct. Other versions pass under the cursor.
- `compaction_head` stores the winner's `schema_version` and the upsert
  compares `(schema_version, compaction_rank, head_id)`: a newer payload
  version always takes the key, so the same-topic bridge at rank -1
  beats the v1 head it copies and still loses to a live v2 write.
- `FamilyHealth` became `TopicHealth`: every version present in the
  log with its row count, compaction heads at it, and each group's
  unread + unresolved rows at it; the compacted verdict is a query
  ([0406] amended). `vulkan topic get` prints that shape.
- Internal message types (Measurement, GoRoutineEvent, Alert,
  JobRequest) declare version 1; topic-level metrics drop the
  `version` label; schemaevolutionlab rewritten same-topic (a key
  superseded before the bridge reaches it is skipped, stop point =
  the bridge's committed cursor); guides/schema-versions shipped, doc
  samples and the sandbox SQL mirror swept.
- Verified: `just verify`, 44/44 fresh-DB labs (five needed lab-side
  edits for the new column / label / lab shape), playground 01/03/07/10,
  website vitest + astro check. ROADMAP Now item removed.

## 2026-08-29 — playground scenarios 04 / 07 / 10 rewritten against the shipped verbs

- The catalog is the measuring instrument: 04 returns
  `consumergroup.Terminal` / `consumergroup.Delay` and drops its two
  handler-outcome traps (three still true stay); 07 sets
  `ConsumerConfig.Start: consumergroup.Head()`, drops its four
  start-from-now traps, concept count 9 -> 10, keeps the read-once-at-
  cursor-creation rule as its one trap; 10 produces under
  `common.ConcurrencyOrdered` with a handler that fails once, drops the
  order-across-failures and const-comment traps, keeps key-alone-orders-
  nothing. Each header records what closed and the record that closed it.
- No new scenario: every Step 1 surface lives inside an existing one.
  All three ran against the dev DB (04: dead on attempt 1 / ready
  attempts=1 / ready delays=1 with can_run_after ahead; 07: committed =
  MAX(id); 10: -30's retry ran before +55). ROADMAP Now Step 2 closed.

## 2026-08-29 — ordered delivery per key; parallel / exclusive / ordered [0617]

- Concurrency values renamed to what the key permits: `parallel` (zero),
  `exclusive`, `ordered`; row status `deferred` unchanged;
  cron_job_config's CHECK-constrained enum dropped in passing.
- `ordered`: a keyed message runs only after every earlier same-key
  message is resolved for the group, one at a time, through failures;
  `dead` releases the lane. exception_queue gains `message_key` +
  `concurrency` (the resolved policy) + an index; the ordered key-lease
  claim refuses while an earlier same-key exception row is unresolved or
  a same-key message_log id sits in `(committed, id)` outside the
  claimer's own range; the exception claim skips an ordered row behind
  an unresolved predecessor. Inside one range same-key ordered messages
  are chained and run back to back in one goroutine; a predecessor that
  did not succeed defers the rest.
- Doc site: guides/ordered-delivery (written first as the proposal),
  ordering / message-key / compare pages; orderedlab is the regression
  (fail-then-succeed order, dead releases, fast path with no deferred
  rows). Shipped in four reviewed chunks: rename, columns, policy, lane.

## 2026-08-29 — a new group's cursor position: consumergroup.Head() [0616]

- `consumergroup.CursorPosition{Kind}` with `Beginning()` / `Head()`;
  `consumer.ConsumerConfig.Start` (zero = beginning) is used only when
  `Register` creates the group's cursor row -- the register transaction
  writes `MAX(id)` of the message log to claimed/committed/settled_head
  through a second literal (`consumergroup.insertCursor`); an existing
  group keeps its position. An in-flight lower id that commits after
  the register is skipped, as Kafka latest / JetStream new do. The
  registered-(created) line carries `committed`. Peer survey and the
  rejected shapes (bool, enum-with-companion-fields) are in the record.
- Doc site: guides/new-group-start (written first as the proposal),
  fan-out and replay pointers; the replay guide's proposed RewindGroup
  now takes the same type (`AtTime`, `AtMessageId` ship with it).
  Sandbox mirror carries both cursor-insert templates; consumergrouplab
  scenario 6 is the regression.

## 2026-08-29 — delivery_log keyed by its own id [0615]

- The composite PK on `attempt` collided when a retry claim handed its
  number back at a busy key gate (logging `deferred` under it) and the
  next claim's outcome logged under the same number -- 23505, row stuck
  `inflight`, consumer stopped (reproduced with the real verbs).
  `delivery_log_<id>` now has `id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY` plus an index
  on `(consumer_group_id, message_id, attempt)`; `attempt` is the run
  an event belongs to and a run can carry more than one event. No verb
  changed. Sandbox mirror + table-design page updated; deliveryloglab
  scenario 6 is the regression.

## 2026-08-29 — handler outcomes: Terminal and Delay [0614]

- A consumerFunc's error is classified at both live handler paths
  (messageconsumer range commit, exceptionconsumer) and on the on-hold
  deliveryconsumer path: a `diagnostic.Permanent` chain dead-letters on
  this attempt, `consumergroup.Delay(d)` runs the delivery again after
  `d` with no failure counted, anything else retries as before.
  `consumergroup.Terminal(cause)` (VK0055) is the user's spelling for
  Permanent -- the diagnostic registry admits only VK codes, so users
  cannot declare their own; `Delay` returns a `*DelayedDelivery`
  unwrapping to VK0054.
- `exception_queue.delays` (baseline DDL + sandbox mirror); `attempts`
  stays the monotonic run count and the retry budget reads
  `attempts - delays` in the claim gate, kill backstop, terminal check,
  and backoff index. `RetryPolicy.MaxDelays` (0 = none) dead-letters a
  Delay returned at the cap; clamped per message like MaxRetries.
  Delivery_log gains status `delayed`. `MessageMeta` gains
  `Attempts`/`Delays`.
- Doc site: guides/handler-outcomes (written first as the proposal),
  errors VK0054/VK0055, lifecycle / dead-letters / quickstart pointers;
  "snooze" banned in CONVENTIONS ## Vocabulary + the Vale rule.
  `just outcome-lab` drives all four outcomes through a real Consume;
  exception / delivery-log / defer / reclaim / key-lease / binding labs
  green, `just verify` green.

## 2026-08-29 — public-API scenario catalog, lab exit refactor

- `examples/playground/` holds 11 programs written as a user would
  against the current library (produce-only, produce-in-tx,
  consume-plain, retry+dead, compacted KV, cron, new-group-deep-topic,
  manager+consumer, idempotent produce, keyed ordering, slow handler);
  each header is its scorecard -- concepts held before domain code and
  the traps hit. Built from a Kafka / River / RabbitMQ / JetStream / SQS
  research pass; it is the measuring instrument for the public-API
  review and surfaced the three no-verb gaps now sketched in ROADMAP
  Now (handler outcome, start from now, strict per-key FIFO). Runtime
  facts settled on the way: RegisterTopic accepts nil cfg; CAS on a
  compacted key = InTransaction + GetCompactionHeadInTx + ProduceInTx;
  IdempotencyKey stays uuid.UUID with uuid.NewSHA1 as the external-key
  path. The ConcurrencyDefer const comment was corrected (defer alone
  runs every message oldest-first; only defer+compaction supersedes).
- Every phase_1 lab and playground program now runs as `main` ->
  `run() error`: labs' `die` panics a labFailure value that `run`
  recovers into its return, so deferred cleanup (DestroyTopic) runs on
  a failed assertion instead of being skipped by os.Exit. 42/42
  fresh-DB suite green.

## 2026-08-29 — table renames, column rules, message-key promotion

- Every table is now `<root>_<kind>` [0611]: config tables gained
  `_config` (+ `_config_log` trails), delivery→exception_queue,
  cursor→consumer_group_cursor, lease→claim_lease,
  key_lease→message_key_lease; cron's runtime columns split out to a
  new 1:1 cron_job_cursor (next/last_scheduled_at + the due index),
  so per-fire churn leaves the config row alone. Column rules [0613]
  landed with it: `_at`/`_after` instants, `_ns` durations, `payload`
  everywhere (cron data→payload including the public Data→Payload and
  ScheduledTime→ScheduledAt), binding display→pattern with
  pattern→pattern_regex.
- The message key was promoted out of compaction [0612]:
  `ProduceOptions.MessageKey` top-level; `CompactionOptions{Enable,
  Rank}` (pointer kept, Enable user-settled for reading clarity);
  `compaction_rank` is nullable and its NULL is the row-level
  never-opted-into-compaction fact every eligibility filter branches
  on. Defer now needs only a key — serialized-by-key delivery with
  full history — via the claimCompacted/claimUncompacted split; a
  same-batch key collision re-defers the loser through the new
  exceptionconsumer RecordDeferred verb instead of parking it
  inflight until lease expiry. concepts/message-key.mdx was the
  proposal page; ordering.mdx rewrote around it.
- Enforcement: tools/conventions walks every baseline CREATE TABLE
  literal for table kinds, `_at`/`_after` on TIMESTAMPTZ, and `_ns`
  durations (sabotage-tested); CONVENTIONS ## Tables/## SQL carry the
  rules and ## Vocabulary bans "compaction key" for the message's key.
- The sweep reached everything that spells a table name: all SQL
  literals and labs, tbls.yml, the doc site's 12 stale pages plus
  both ASCII diagrams, the regenerated codes.json, and the sandbox's
  byte-exact SQL mirror (drifted 7/9 owners; re-synced, renamed, and
  its produce path updated for the new insert shape).
- Verified at close-out: full fresh-DB suite 42/42 (the one failure
  was destroy-system-lab's own stale table list), the deferlab flake
  did not recur, `just schema-diagram-fresh` snapshot matches the
  records' final shape, site build + playwright 18/18.

## 2026-08-28 — the table-design page

- concepts/table-design ships the DDL diagram, closing the last
  content-owed item on the ROADMAP Now list: one ASCII topology
  diagram — the control-plane ownership spine, the id-names-the-family
  seam, the three FK crossings back to consumer_group — plus
  per-table structural facts and a "deliberate absences" section (no
  topic_id in the family, no FK into message_log, destroy is DROP).
- Depth deliberately capped above column lists: keys and relationships
  move rarely, so the page can't silently drift from DDL no check
  watches. Facts verified against createSystemTables and
  createTopicTables.
- Inbound links from architecture, quickstart step 5, and routing;
  the page slots after architecture on the Concepts board.

## 2026-08-28 — doc-content sweep: one split, a site-wide link pass

- transactional-produce (1709 words, 2.5x the site median) split: its
  side-effects and retries sections became guides/side-effects-and-
  retries — the two things outside the commit guarantee on one page —
  per the user's smaller-docs-with-interweaving-links preference.
- Link pass over the four pages with zero outbound links
  (transactional-produce, migrations, ordering, routing) and the
  unreferenced compare pages: quickstart's headline step now links the
  produce guide, migrations links its VK0022/VK0023/VK0053 threads,
  ordering links architecture/lifecycle/both compare pages, routing
  links fan-out, fan-out's lag warning links consumer-timeouts and
  dead-letters, dead-letters and replay name each other as sibling
  proposals, why-vulkan's capability table links fan-out/routing/
  ordering.
- Two missing pages the sweep surfaced parked in ROADMAP Later: a
  compaction concept page and a workers/maintenance-fleet page.

## 2026-08-28 — code threads carry example attribute values

- The [0590] gap closed by [0610]: every error/event thread's example
  log line now carries example values for its own placeholder names,
  so pasting it into the paste box fills the thread's queries and fix
  — the feature demonstrates itself.
- One shared value table (orders.created, group id 7, message 214,
  topic_janitor, alert.partition_count) keeps the whole board on one
  fictional deployment; VK0023 overrides the version pair so its fix
  never migrates downward. Composition mirrors the real renderers,
  and a round-trip test over codes.json proves every composed line
  fills all of its own names.
- LogLine's blank-marking path and the markPlaceholders helper went
  with it — every placeholder on a composed line now fills, so the
  marked-blank state no longer exists.

## 2026-08-28 — the consumer-timeouts guide

- New small page guides/consumer-timeouts closes the Now-list gap the
  ROADMAP named: the counters and events were documented (VK0050,
  VK0052, abandoned_count on VK0041) but no page said what a reader
  should do about them. Placement settled as a standalone guide with
  interweaving links — the user's stated preference over growing an
  existing page.
- The page walks the cancel -> grace -> abandon window with the real
  CallSafely strings (email-sender at 5s, message 214, abandoned at
  5.1s), fixes it with a ctx-respecting handler (http.Post vs
  NewRequestWithContext), and splits the two knobs: Message.Timeout
  for slow work, TimeoutGrace for slow cancellation response only.
- Inbound links added where a reader actually lands: VK0041's
  abandoned_count bullet, VK0050, VK0052's investigate line, and
  concepts/lifecycle's retries section; Guides board row added.

## 2026-08-28 — transactional-produce gets the side-effect footgun

- New "Side effects don't roll back" section on
  guides/transactional-produce, the first Now-list content item owed:
  sendEmailConfirmation() inside the InTransaction closure fires even
  when the produce fails and the payment rolls back, worked with real
  values (order 4127, jamie@example.com).
- The section walks the half-fix too — the call behind the nil check,
  with the catch that an error return may be an ambiguous commit, so
  error also means no email — then the crash-after-commit gap, landing
  on producing EmailRequested in the same commit with an email-sender
  consumer group doing the send (the page's existing relay framing).
- First page drafted against website/VOICE.md's checklist as its own
  pass: a non-compiling `...` placeholder and a place-shaped
  dead-letter clause caught and fixed.

## 2026-08-28 — the doc site's prose voice file

- website/VOICE.md ships and website/CLAUDE.md loads it, design in
  [0609]: verbatim author samples (session messages, raw
  explain-it-back answers), two contrastive same-passage pairs,
  measurable rules, and a revision checklist run as its own pass.
  AI-drafted site prose now writes against it.
- Behind it: a voice profile mined from ~3,600 hand-typed session
  messages across 71 transcripts plus the repo's user-authored
  strata, and a two-track research sweep (academic + practitioner)
  of style-imitation evidence. The working doc was folded into
  [0609], the ROADMAP Later rungs item, and VOICE.md's
  ## Sample sources, then deleted the same day.

## 2026-08-28 — Playwright covers the editor swap and the initial-JS ceiling

- Two flow tests close the coverage gaps the [0607] bootstrap left,
  design in [0608]. The editor test waits for CodeMirror over the
  static shell, asserts the shell is removed, and types until the
  panel chip leaves "auto re-runs" — the mount and its setSql wiring,
  previously checked by hand.
- The initial-JS test sums script response bytes on the homepage at a
  640px viewport — below the sandbox gate nothing more ever hydrates,
  so the count is stable, answering the flakiness that helped sink the
  import-graph walk [0594] (which stays rejected). Measured 82,080 raw
  bytes; ceiling 96,000; no PGlite chunk may be requested there.
- website/CONVENTIONS.md ## Islands & loading reworded to describe the
  shipped check instead of promising an unenforced ceiling. All six
  runs (both tests × 3 engines) green.

## 2026-08-28 — website CSS review: one focus ring, one post frame

- The sweep behind it came back clean on the enforced rules — no raw
  values outside the tokens layer, only the two sanctioned breakpoints,
  token discipline intact. What it found was duplication.
- The focus ring is now stated once in the base layer for everything
  interactive (a/button/select/summary at 2px offset, input/textarea
  hugging at 1px, `:where()` so any scoped override still wins); nine
  restatements deleted across eight components and the era-button
  utility. One deliberate standardization: add-consumer's select ring
  offset moved 1px to match every other select.
- thread-post and error-post shared 85 identical lines of frame CSS —
  header strip, author column, post body, and the phone collapse. Both
  now render a new post-frame component (framed/header/headerTone/
  authorCell/authorIgnored snippet props) carrying that CSS once;
  thread-post.css and error-post.css keep only their own cell contents.
  Pagefind behavior preserved: thread authors stay ignored, the error
  code cell stays indexable.
- The off-list `.post-body :global(p)` crossing went from two components
  to one, and the website CONVENTIONS `:global()` sanctioned list now
  names it.
- Verified: full-page screenshots before/after are byte-identical on the
  error thread, 404, and phone widths (home differs only by the live
  sandbox's row-fade timing — it differs from itself the same way); all
  12 Playwright flows pass; prettier/eslint/stylelint/svelte-check
  clean. Left as-is, deliberately: the empty compositions layer (no
  third call site yet), the varied inline-error font sizes, and the
  four remaining ~80+-line style files (compat-matrix 131,
  consumer-card 104, accept-all-modal 102, member-profile 94) — single
  components, splitting would be busywork.

## 2026-08-28 — sandbox and database code split to the conventions' own shape

- The sandbox tree's three biggest files carried logic where the gist
  should be; each got the split the rules already name, no new behavior.
- sandbox.svelte 299 -> 82 lines: a SandboxState runes class in
  sandbox-state.svelte.ts owns the database, the AutoRunner, the consumer
  cards, and every control's flags (the ## Components stateful/
  presentational split); busy/bootFailed are $derived class fields — the
  first state class to use them.
- database.ts 357 -> 301 with VulkanDatabase at ~line 66 instead of 134:
  the table-exact row types and read-models moved to sandbox/model.ts,
  the TS sibling of a datastore's model.go.
- sql-panel's 45-line onMount became mountEditorOnIdle in
  sql-panel/mount-editor.ts (type-only CodeMirror import, so the chunk
  stays out of the initial payload — verified in the build output);
  editor.ts moved beside it, sql-panel being its only importer (the seam
  law). All six sandbox Playwright flows pass across the three engines;
  the editor swap itself was checked by hand — the missing assertion is
  now a ROADMAP Now item.
- ChaosDiagram.astro noted as pre-conventions legacy (root-level .astro,
  raw hex styles, prop default) and deliberately left alone.

## 2026-08-28 — sandbox close freeze fixed; Playwright flows bootstrapped [0607]

- The freeze the [0606] spot check surfaced is fixed the same day:
  DatabaseState registers every statement-running operation before its
  first await and close() refuses new work, drains the pending set,
  then shuts PGlite down — so leaving a booted sandbox no longer
  strands the next page on a spinning wasm loop. Four instrumented
  navigation runs that previously froze 4/4 now show no main-thread
  stall at all, and reset() rides the same drain.
- Playwright is now real, not just declared: `@playwright/test` devDep,
  `playwright.config.ts` with chromium/firefox/webkit projects against
  the built site, and `tests/flows.spec.ts` covering home render,
  sandbox boot, search + back-navigation, and the freeze regression —
  12/12 green across all three engines, wired into `npm run verify`
  (vitest scoped to `src` so the two runners keep their own files).

## 2026-08-28 — the doc site's browser support line [0606]

- The site now declares what it supports: Baseline Widely Available
  (Chrome/Edge 121+, Firefox 123+, Safari/iOS 17.2+ — 87% of tracked
  global usage) as the supported line, with the build floor pinned as
  `vite.build.target` in astro.config.mjs (chrome111/edge111/
  firefox114/safari16.4/ios16.4) so a toolchain major can no longer
  move it silently. Rules in website/CONVENTIONS.md ## Browser
  support. A three-engine spot check (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit
  against the built site) passed every flow — home, sandbox boot,
  search, back-navigation, doc pages — and surfaced one shipped bug:
  PGlite's close() deadlocks when a query is still in flight, so
  navigating off the homepage while the sandbox is active can freeze
  the destination page (reproduced in Node against 0.5.6 and 0.5.8;
  fixed the same day [0607]).

## 2026-08-28 — the member profile page [0605]

- Clicking brandon's name or avatar on any thread post now opens
  `/members/brandon/`, a phpBB-shaped "Viewing profile" page. Every
  fact on it is real: Total posts is the thread count the posts
  already show, Website is the repo, and Joined is the repo's first
  commit date — a `firstCommitDate()` read off the commit-log walk
  the build already runs, since the newest-first walk ends holding
  the oldest date.
- The "Personal text" strip (SMF's name for a profile's free-text
  field) is the Stanley Parable loading screen as forum
  furniture: "the end is never " scrolling forever through an
  overflow-hidden box, two identical copies sliding one width so the
  loop restarts invisibly. Motion sits behind
  `prefers-reduced-motion`; the still version is the line cut off at
  the box edge.

## 2026-08-27 — mobile-friendly doc site [0602] [0604]

- Two breakpoints, declared in `website/CONVENTIONS.md`: 640px collapses
  the layout, 761px gates the sandbox. Media queries cannot read custom
  properties, so the values are convention rather than tokens, and
  touch-target work keys off `(pointer: coarse)` instead of a width —
  the era look is untouched on a mouse.
- The sandbox never loads on a phone. Its island boots PGlite in
  `onMount`, so hydration itself is the ~16MB download (9.6MB wasm +
  6MB data) for a console unusable at that width. The homepage's whole
  intro-plus-sandbox post became one route-local component hydrated on
  `client:media="(min-width: 761px)"` and hidden below it, so the JS is
  never fetched; a dedicated hero section will fill that slot at every
  width. CSS-hiding under `client:visible` was rejected — what
  IntersectionObserver reports for a boxless target is fragile ground
  for a 16MB gate.
- The layout work the sweep found: one token
  (`--grid-board-columns`) forced ~460px of row into the ~286px a 390px
  phone leaves inside the page frame, so its five consumers collapse to
  an icon-plus-content grid; the posts' 150px author column becomes a
  header strip above the body; a `flex-wrap`/`min-width: 0` pass across
  fourteen rows; tables scroll in their own box and inline code, caught
  messages, and search excerpts wrap instead of widening the page. The
  cookie notice is hidden below 640px — the bit stays a desktop bit
  rather than a bar eating a third of a phone screen — and `--z-notice`
  puts the failure banner above it where the two used to tie.
- Chrome skips same-document view transitions on mobile (Chromium
  regression 456078987) and leaks the rejection of a `ready` promise the
  spec says to mark handled. Astro's router never touches `ready`, so
  the failure banner reported a cross-fade that did not play as a page
  failure. Caught at the source —
  `event.viewTransition.ready.catch()` on `astro:before-swap`, the fix
  Nuxt applied inside its own router — and the unhandledrejection net
  stays fully strict. Filtering exception names at the net shipped
  first [0603] and was superseded the same day: `InvalidStateError` is a
  wrong-state class, and a global skip would hide real faults.

## 2026-08-27 — doc site versioning [0601]

- One live site at the apex; a release deploys the same build twice —
  `just site-deploy` and `just site-freeze <slug>` — and the frozen alias
  (`<slug>.vulkan-5ss.pages.dev`) is never deployed to again. The
  React/Vue frozen-archive model on Cloudflare Pages branch aliases;
  in-source snapshot copies rejected.
- No build carries the version list: `public/versions.json` on the live
  origin is the one registry, fetched at read time by every deployment
  (CORS via `public/_headers`). An old deployment grows the version select
  and starts showing "You are reading the {version} docs" the moment the
  live registry moves, without being redeployed.
- Each build carries only its own stamp (`site.ts` `docsVersion`, `main`
  pre-release). The visit bar renders version-select at its left edge,
  the visit facts on the right; every page canonicals to the live origin,
  and Cloudflare's
  `x-robots-tag: noindex` on alias domains keeps old versions out of
  search. A throwaway v0-demo freeze proved the whole flow — dropdown,
  old-docs notice, same-path switching — and was deleted after review.

## 2026-08-27 — the doc site's cookie notice [0599] [0600]

- The site sets no cookies, so the one piece of chrome every reader is trained
  to look at is where it says so. Act one copies the compliance-vendor
  standard — "we value your privacy", the cookies-and-similar-technologies
  paragraph, Accept all / Reject non-essential / Manage preferences. Act two
  is the site's real privacy note: no cookies, no analytics, no third party,
  only localStorage the reader's own browser holds.
- Its own surface, never `site-notice`. That is the shipped error channel, and
  a prank on it would teach readers to ignore the one banner that means
  something actually broke. Separate component, separate state, opposite
  screen edge. First visit, one answer per browser, no veil and no focus trap
  on the bar — a real consent bar does not block the page.
- The pressed control is the whole input: `answers.ts` is a discriminated
  union keyed by control, so the modal answer carries no content and the
  compiler refuses any read of one. Reject and Manage rewrite the bar in place
  through `cookie-answer`; Accept all gets `accept-all-modal`, its own
  component free to diverge — which it did.
- Accept all's consequence: the page stutters (opacity blinks in the base
  layer plus scroll jolts, modal opening on `animationend`), then a routing
  and account number type out a digit at a time over a dark veil with memes
  pasted around the box. The numbers are noise per opening but the shape is
  real — valid ABA checksum, genuine district prefix — because a number of the
  wrong length reads as a prop.
- Two traps found and closed while building: the stutter's shove is a scroll,
  never a transform, because a transform on the page becomes the containing
  block for every `position: fixed` child and would fling the consent bar to
  the document bottom mid-animation; and the `animationend` listener checks
  `event.target`, since that event bubbles and a descendant's animation ending
  would otherwise cut the stutter short.
- Net log confirms the meme files are fetched only when the modal renders — a
  plain page load requests neither. The art is placeholder: it is Nickelodeon's
  and must be swapped for CC0 or CC BY before the site ships (roadmap, Now).

## 2026-08-27 — layered error handling on the doc site [0597] [0598]

- Four tiers, disruptiveness matched to scope. Inline at the source stays the
  default and the workhorse: `<svelte:boundary>` catches render and effect
  throws only, so DOM handlers and async work keep their own call-site
  try/catch under every other tier.
- The holes the survey found are closed: the sandbox's boot-failure status was
  written and read nowhere (the progress overlay vanished and the controls
  re-enabled with no message) and now raises a notice with Reset live as the
  retry; the SQL panel's CodeMirror import was an uncaught dynamic import
  leaving a silently read-only box; a throw inside search left `searching…` up
  for good; the auto-run clock could die silently on an escaped throw; and
  `String(caught)` made `[object Object]` reachable — every caught value now
  passes through one helper.
- New `island-boundary` wraps the five islands with real render risk — the
  sandbox, search, and the three log-line islands whose `$derived` chains parse
  reader-pasted text. Its failed face carries a working retry, which recreates
  the markup while the island's own state survives.
- One page-level notice, fed only by the three global nets registered once in
  `BoardLayout`'s bundled script — window `error`, `unhandledrejection`, and
  Vite's `vite:preloadError`. A banner for faults the reader can wave away; the
  modal only for the stale-chunk-after-redeploy case, which reloads once behind
  a sessionStorage guard before it asks. A bundled module runs once per visit,
  so the listeners survive ClientRouter swaps.
- The full-page face was built, storied, and cut in the same round [0598]: the
  shell is prerendered, so prose always renders and no honest trigger exists.
  Error toasts are banned outright — an auto-dismissing error is missable.
- website/CONVENTIONS.md gained `## Errors`, owning what the root file cannot:
  which surface a failure uses, and the split between reader-typed SQL (the
  real Postgres message, verbatim — the console is a terminal) and site
  machinery (the house problem + fix grammar). The two internal throws in the
  sandbox database were reworded to match.
- Verify floor green through the build: `astro check` clean, Vitest passing,
  419 pages built, and the notice module confirmed shared between the layout
  script and the island in `dist/`.

## 2026-08-26 — the decision records on the board [0596]

- New Decision records board: a generated index thread at `/decisions/`
  plus one thread per record at `/decisions/NNNN/` — all 335 records,
  `[NNNN]` citations linkified, Pagefind-indexed. The records stay
  append-only source files, read in place from docs/decisions by a
  second content collection.
- The board machinery now runs on a neutral Thread shape fed by both
  collections; 11 records (0558–0568) had their metadata normalized to
  the declared frontmatter format, prose untouched.
- Full site verify floor green; 417 pages built.

## 2026-08-26 — the spacing token scale [0595]

- The closed spacing scale website/CONVENTIONS.md declared now exists:
  `--space-1` … `--space-34`, 22 steps named by their pixel value, one tier
  beside the z-index scale. The scale is the exact set the design already
  used — no value was snapped, so nothing moved visually.
- Every margin, padding, and gap across 36 component stylesheets, the three
  layout scoped blocks, and global.css now consumes the scale; stylelint's
  declaration-strict-value list gained the spacing properties, so a new
  value cannot enter without adding its step to the tokens layer.
- Full site verify floor green; the stylelint rule was sabotage-checked
  against raw px hidden in mixed shorthands and logical properties.

## 2026-08-26 — the night board [0593]

- The footer's inert `Board style: Vulkan Classic ▾` chip is a real `<select>`
  with a second entry. Choosing one sets `data-board-style` on `<html>`, which
  is the whole mechanism: the tokens layer serves a different palette and no
  component changed, because all 42 component stylesheets already carry zero
  raw colours.
- The night palette follows the era's dark-board convention — near-black
  content ground, navy chrome, silver text — over its own primitive sheet.
  Amber is excluded from the swap on purpose: it means new-or-act and nothing
  else [0583], so only the grounds beneath it darken.
- Shiki bakes fence colours at build time, so both themes now ship with
  `defaultColor: false` and the base layer reads `--shiki-light` /
  `--shiki-dark`. That is the one place a board style is read outside the
  tokens layer.
- An `is:inline` script in `BoardLayout`'s `<head>` applies the style before
  the first paint and again on `astro:after-swap` — ClientRouter [0592] copies
  the incoming document's `<html>` attributes, and the static build carries
  none. `prefers-color-scheme` seeds the first visit; a stored choice outranks
  it from then on.
- Cost: `BoardFooter` became a `client:idle` island, 1.6 KB raw / 0.8 KB
  gzipped on every page.

## 2026-08-26 — soft navigation across the board [0592]

- `<ClientRouter />` in `BoardLayout.astro` — the only layout that owns a
  `<head>` — puts all 80 pages on view transitions. The swap keeps `window` and
  the module registry, so PGlite's cached responses and compiled wasm survive:
  returning to the homepage skips the 5.53 MB download and the 10 MB compile,
  and runs only instantiate, initdb, the topic DDL and the seed.
- The roadmap asked for `transition:persist` on the sandbox, which cannot work
  — Astro drops a persisted element the destination page lacks, and the sandbox
  is on one page. Persisting the database at all needs `DatabaseState` hoisted
  to a module singleton with the consumer cards alongside it; not taken.
- `DatabaseState.close()` is new and runs from the sandbox's `onDestroy`: a full
  page load used to release the 128 MB wasm memory for free, and a soft
  navigation does not. `reset()` routes through it instead of repeating it.
- The reduced-motion guard for `::view-transition-*` is ours, in global.css.
  Astro's own ships only when a `transition:*` directive is used, so with none
  the cross-fade is the browser's default and nothing else gates it.
- Cost: 16.29 KB raw / 5.55 KB gzipped of router on every page.

## 2026-08-26 — paste your log line, and the thread fills [0590]

- A declared fix now carries the same `{attribute}` placeholders [0589] gave
  diagnose queries, filled from the values the raise attached. `Error()` and
  `LogValue()` fill through the exported `Error.Fill`, which the CLI also uses
  on its own `cliFixes` rewrites — so a fix naming a vulkan command runs
  verbatim as pasted. Four fixes took a placeholder: VK0004, VK0013, VK0022,
  VK0023.
- The rule the build surfaced: a fix placeholder must be attachable at EVERY
  raise site, because one string serves all of them. A `tools/conventions` walk
  over every `return <declared Err>` enforces it. VK0005 and VK0014 failed it —
  four raise sites resolve by id and the name is unknowable there — so they
  kept their static fix and gained an id-keyed diagnose query, which also
  closed a [0589] gap where those sites raised a condition whose query named a
  value their line never carried.
- Code threads replaced the search strip with a paste box. A pasted line fills
  the diagnose queries, the fix, and the copy button, looked up BY NAME across
  the three shapes the library emits — slog's text handler, JSON, and the
  `Error()` one-liner. Nothing parses the line's grammar and nothing is stored.
- A value enters SQL by the quoting already around its blank: quoted position
  doubles any `'`, bare position takes only an identifier or a number and
  otherwise stays a blank rather than render SQL that cannot run.

## 2026-08-25 — declarations say what to look at, in SQL [0589]

- A `diagnostic` declaration now carries diagnose queries: `Diagnose(...)`
  chains an ordered set of `NewQuery(label, sql)` onto an Err* or Event, and
  the SQL names its blanks `{attribute_name}` after the log attributes the
  condition's own line already carries. 18 of 53 codes declare them; guards
  declare none and no section renders.
- Three surfaces read the one declaration. `vulkan explain VK0029` renders the
  queries under the block (the CLI error block stays tight and points there),
  the code thread pages read them from `website/src/data/codes.json`, and the
  Go doc comment carries a one-line pointer — gopls hover shows the doc and the
  type but never the initializer, so the queries are invisible in the IDE.
- `tools/codeexport` writes the whole declaration record, not the queries
  alone, which finally gave the error pages' hand-copied frontmatter its parked
  drift check: `just site-verify` regenerates, diffs, and compares every page's
  title, fix, recovery and kind against the declaration.
- The log attribute registry became binding without becoming code. A
  `tools/conventions` walk parses the `### Attributes` table out of
  CONVENTIONS.md and rejects any placeholder — or any raised `With` pair —
  naming something unregistered. It found seven pre-existing violations on its
  first run.
- Swept `attr`/`attrs`, `door`, `sentinel` and `hole` out of every live Go file
  and the ROADMAP; historical records keep the words they were written with.

## 2026-08-25 — the migrations guide shows the gate as a grid [0588]

- The compatibility matrix on guides/migrations is generated, not written:
  `tools/compatexport` walks every (build version, database version) pair
  through `migrate.ClassifySchemaSupport` — the same call the library makes
  at Register — and writes the verdicts to `website/src/data/compat.json`.
  The page does a table lookup; TS never compares a version to a floor.
- The rule got one home in the process. `assertVersionSupported` is now a
  switch over the new classifier, and `migrate.Version(registry)` absorbed
  the `len(Registry)+1` formula both scope registries had spelled out.
- The exporter takes registries as parameters rather than reading the
  package-level ones, so a fixture registry can prove the rule across
  versions that do not exist yet — the empty pre-v1 registries give a
  one-cell grid on their own. Its tests assert the fixture's whole 5x5 as a
  text literal.
- `just site-compat` regenerates; `just site-verify` regenerates and diffs,
  so a registry change that skips the export fails the build. The component
  is static (no `client:` directive, zero JS added to the page).

## 2026-08-25 — the homepage console grew into a consumer-flow sandbox [0585] [0586] [0587]

- The board index now runs the whole produce/claim path in the browser.
  Produce a message, watch consumer instances claim it off their group's
  cursor, and read `message_log_1` and `cursor_1` beside them — one PGlite
  Postgres shared by every panel and card, seeded from the library's own
  DDL and produce statement.
- It is a harness, not a simulation: nine more statements extracted
  byte-exact from the Go sources (getGroup, registerGroup's three,
  freshClaimMessagesWithCursor's snapshot and gate, claimMessages,
  readMessages, commit's lease DELETE). Only the loop that calls them and
  the handler it hands each message to belong to the page. Drift is now
  counted per `-- vulkan: <owner>` tag rather than per file, so a verb the
  site never runs needs no case while a statement added to a mirrored verb
  still fails the build [0586].
- The claim path's snapshot gate proves on the first poll under PGlite, so
  Tick runs `freshClaimMessagesWithCursor` unchanged — structural, not
  lucky: the snapshot statement takes no xid, and one backend means every
  producer transaction has already committed [0585].
- Consumers auto-run on their own clocks, roughly once a second with
  jitter, replacing the manual Run button outright [0587]. `ChromeButton`
  gained a `pressed: boolean | null` toggle state in muted amber;
  `AutoRunner` owns the timers as plain TS so vitest can drive it with
  fake timers.
- A consumer is a group membership: adding one declares a new group (its
  cursor starts at 0, so it replays) or joins an existing one (the two
  claim disjoint ranges off one cursor). Reset sandbox drops the database
  and rebuilds it from the seed, labeled a page control rather than an API
  verb — rewinding a group is not a Vulkan verb.
- Each panel owns a default query, mounts CodeMirror, and re-runs after any
  write only while the visitor has not edited it; once edited it marks
  itself `edited · behind` and waits. New result rows and new consumer
  lines fade in from amber via `@starting-style`, behind
  `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- Verified: `just site-verify` green (0 errors, 21 vitest tests across 3
  files), the full build, and a browser pass by the user — produce, the
  clocks claiming it, the cursor advancing, Reset. Homepage initial JS
  stayed dynamic-only for PGlite and CodeMirror.

## 2026-08-23 — the doc site rebuilt as a message board [0582] [0583] [0584]

- Starlight uninstalled; the board serves the whole site. Astro core
  carries it — glob loader with this project's own zod schema, Pagefind,
  @astrojs/mdx — and the loader's generateId keeps each file's casing, so
  the deployed URLs survived the swap unchanged. Astro 6 → 7 (rolldown)
  landed on top with no code changes. Islands are Svelte 5, CSS is
  vanilla CUBE with a sibling stylesheet per component, page-derived
  facts live in route-local `_<page>/` directories, and `client:load` is
  banned so the homepage ships static HTML/CSS.
- A page is a thread: board index at `/`, thread lists at
  `/boards/<slug>/`, threads at `/<id>/`, code threads at
  `/errors/VKxxxx/` where the OP is the code itself and a declared fix
  renders as the ACCEPTED ANSWER post. Read state comes from one
  append-only localStorage page-visit log feeding the visit bar, the
  amber folders and the new `/whats-new/` page alike. Search is Pagefind
  behind a board-styled island (`/search/`, `?q=` deep links).
- The homepage SQL console runs Postgres in the browser (PGlite) against
  the library's own statements: 33 files extracted byte-exact from the Go
  sources, a vitest drift test holding them verbatim, and build-time
  shell rows produced by running the same statements in Node.
- Frontend rules got their own file, `website/CONVENTIONS.md`, loaded via
  `website/CLAUDE.md` and enforced by `just site-verify` — prettier,
  eslint, stylelint (declaration-strict-value), astro check at strictest,
  svelte-check, remark-lint, Vale carrying the ## Vocabulary registry,
  vitest. Storybook covers every component.
- Verified: 80 pages built with 72 indexed, the full verify chain green,
  vitest 9/9, Storybook build, and four CDP browser suites (console first
  run, board navigation, search, copy/whats-new).

## 2026-08-22 — doc site rewritten to the real API [0581]

- Every non-error page now documents behavior that ships. The site's
  invented surface (vulkan.Queue, Subscribe, functional options,
  FromOffset, partition keys, replay/redrive verbs) is gone; each page's
  Go samples were compiled and vetted against the working tree before it
  landed; unshipped capabilities carry Proposed badges or asides and are
  never checkmarked in the comparison tables; every unsourced performance
  number was stripped and points at the benchmark pipeline instead.
- The ## Vocabulary registry now governs prose, titles and slugs:
  `guides/transactional-enqueue` → `transactional-produce`,
  `concepts/streams` → `concepts/fan-out` ("Fan-out, Retention &
  Replay"), `concepts/ordering` → "Ordering & Concurrency".
- Two code bugs the rewrite surfaced were fixed with it: the RoutingKey
  doc comment claimed a keyless message reaches every group (it reaches
  only groups with no bindings), and deleteSystemTables omitted
  worker_log, whose FK would have broken the drop — added there and to
  destroysystemlab's assertions, lab green.

## 2026-08-22 — migration txn steps run under lock_timeout [0579]

- runStepWithTx sets `SET LOCAL lock_timeout = '2000ms'` right after
  Begin (own ddlLockTimeout const matching the producer/janitor sites;
  no config field), so a step queued behind live traffic gives up
  instead of stalling the queries queued behind its DDL. A 55P03 on the
  txn path is reclassified Transient via new declared error VK0053 and
  the atomically rolled-back step retries under the existing
  DatastoreRetry schedule; NoTxn steps keep fail-fast (CREATE INDEX
  CONCURRENTLY's INVALID-index hazard). Inert until release-era ALTER
  steps exist. Landed together: VK0053 docs page + errors index row,
  guides/migrations.mdx behavior sentence, Migration doc comment
  authoring-rules line. Verified: go test -race pkg/migrate,
  tools/conventions, schemaevolutionlab + schemagatelab.

## 2026-08-22 — cross-version compatibility: MinCompatibleVersion gate + compat lab [0580]

- Every migration step now declares MinCompatibleVersion (0 = additive,
  own version = breaking; empty steps bump the version for
  compatibility-only releases), stored per migration_log row in the v1.0
  baseline DDL. The schema gate reads both facts in one query and admits
  a build iff `min_compatible_version <= build <= current` — additive
  skew is the rolling-deploy window, a breaking step past the build
  refuses at Register (VK0023 attrs now min_compatible_version +
  build_version). Build versions derive from the registries
  (`len(Registry) + 1`); the four Min/Max constants are gone.
  schemagatelab reshaped (additive window, breaking refusal, per-topic
  skew via a sibling topic); tools/compat nested module + `just
  compat-lab` dry-run green (pins the working tree until two releases
  exist); CONVENTIONS ## Migrations release-era rules, website
  guides/migrations.mdx with the compatibility table, and the AGENTS.md
  release checklist landed in the same change.

## 2026-08-22 — fillfactor audit closed: adopt nothing [0578]

- Static pass classified every table's update paths (cursor /
  compaction_head / delivery the real candidates; lease, key_lease,
  worker_instance, cron_job ruled out structurally), then live
  benchmarks confirmed all three were already ~100% HOT at default
  fillfactor — throughput identical within noise, [0574]'s 36k dead
  tuples revealed as HOT-chain tuples pruned in place. Baseline DDL
  untouched.
- New bench/fillfactor consume-side harness (pre-fill a fresh topic,
  drain through real ConsumerInstance.Consume calls; failure-rate flag
  cycles the exception window for delivery churn; per-cell
  pg_stat_user_tables HOT-ratio evidence). bench/compaction's driver
  gained -head-fillfactor plus head HOT/update stats for the
  compaction_head cells.

## 2026-08-22 — worker metadata history as append-only worker_log [0577]

- worker_log completes [0570]'s reservation: a full-snapshot row (name
  copied for join-free operator scans, metadata, target_instances,
  declared_by = ProcessIdentity, declared_at) appended in the same
  transaction as every worker create and metadata replace; machinery
  never reads it, no retention (worker_log/topic_log TTL revisit parked).
- registerWorker's replace path restructured onto replaceConfig's
  decide-before-writing shape: on insert conflict it reads the row with
  the comparison computed server-side (jsonb equality — Go never compares
  marshaled bytes against the normalized column) and returns without
  writing when the declaration matches. No-change redeclares stop writing
  entirely, ending the dead tuple per worker row per process start.
- Verified on a fresh DB: workerclaimlab's three consumers left exactly
  one log row per worker; a driven replace appended one row and a same-
  metadata redeclare appended none.

## 2026-08-22 — CLI --output json + json tags on public read-models [0575][0576]

- `--output <text|json>` root persistent flag: json stdout is exactly one
  parseable document per command, success or failure. Errors render on
  stderr as `{"error": {...}}` mirroring diagnostic.Error's LogValue parts
  (a plain failUsage/failOp error reduces to problem only); exit codes
  unchanged. failPrinted failures became result-document data
  (exists:false, exit 1 kept), so json stdout never carries prose.
- Every public read-model gained `json:"snake_case"` tags spelling the
  log-attr registry's keys (topic, version, group, message_id, *_count) --
  new CONVENTIONS.md rule under ## Package layout, the json sibling of the
  `db:` tag rule. JobRequest and Alert are stored payloads, so their
  stored key shape changed (pre-v1); the two lab mirrors reading old keys
  via SQL (cronlab, alertlab) swept.
- Durations render as unit-carrying strings, so composed or
  duration-carrying shapes got CLI-owned *Document structs beside their
  command; duration-free tagged read-models marshal directly.
- Mutations follow the surveyed conventions (kubectl/gh/aws/docker/stripe/
  gcloud): destroys emit small what-happened records and require --yes in
  json mode; cron run emits {cron_job, message_id}; rename echoes the
  get-shape; migrate emits summary documents; manager run rejects the
  flag; -q with --output json is a usage error.
- 42/42 fresh-DB labs (suite grew by compactiondeadlocklab, [0574]).

## 2026-08-22 — compaction-key deadlock evaluation [0574]

- Batched Produce proven cycle-free: the batcher's ascending-key sort is one
  global lock order, confirmed by the new compactiondeadlocklab
  (`just compaction-deadlock-lab`) and zero deadlocks across every
  bench/compaction cell.
- ProduceInTx confirmed as the one deadlock site; the 40P01 classifies
  transient and the caller's closure rerun lands both sides. Library-side
  retry rejected — guidance is to order ProduceInTx calls by compaction key.
- Hot-key serialization measured (bench/compaction/RESULTS.md): one hot key
  = ~50% of unkeyed throughput as a flat floor, not a cliff; the hurt case
  is hot key × many producer processes. ProduceOptions.Compaction and
  ProduceInTx doc comments updated; dead-tuple findings feed the
  fillfactor audit.

## 2026-08-22 — per-topic table split: cursor, lease, key_lease, compaction_head, binding, binding_log [0571]

- The six shared coordination tables became per-topic interpolated tables
  (cursor_<id>, lease_<id>, key_lease_<id>, compaction_head_<id>,
  binding_<id>, binding_log_<id>), applying the [0571] split rule: a topic's
  family grows 4 -> 10 tables and the shared schema reduces to exactly
  catalog + fleet + cross-scope history (system, topic, topic_log,
  consumer_group, worker, worker_instance, cron_job, migration_log).
- compaction_head_<id> dropped its topic_id column -- PK is compaction_key
  alone. Topic destroy became a DROP TABLE loop over all ten tables,
  deleting the three cross-table DELETEs (lease/key_lease via group-id
  subqueries, compaction_head by topic_id); the janitor's partition-drop
  and sweep cleanups lost their topic_id predicates the same way.
- Three verbs gained explicit topic context: ForceReclaimRange and
  DeclareBindings take topicId; KeyLeaseClaim/KeyLeaseData carry TopicId so
  Release can name the claim's table.
- The two cross-topic reads resolve topic ids from consumer_group and loop:
  ListBindingLog (one query per topic's binding_log_<id>) and the consumer
  group janitor's waiting-declaration sweep -- [0573]'s one batched DELETE
  per tick became one per topic's table per tick.
- 22 labs swept to the interpolated names; destroy assertions reshaped from
  0-row counts to table-absence (to_regclass). 41/41 fresh-DB suite.

## 2026-08-22 — binding_log retention via the consumer group janitor [0573]

- Waiting declaration rows older than a flat 7d TTL are swept in one
  batched DELETE per tick, keeping each declarer's newest waiting row so
  dead waiters stay visible in listings; installed rows are kept forever
  as the set-change audit. New OwnerSystem worker kind
  consumer_group_janitor under pkg/consumergroup/janitor -- hourly poll,
  Debug swept_count line only on ticks that deleted rows -- declared at
  RegisterSystem, provisioned by the system manager and every consumer's
  embedded manager.
- Naming pattern settled: each domain's cleanup worker is its janitor;
  the topic kind renamed "janitor" -> "topic_janitor".
- bindinglab extended with the sweep step (superseded rows deleted, each
  declarer's newest waiting row and all installed rows kept).

## 2026-08-22 — Topic config history as append-only topic_log [0570]

- The topic row stays the enforced truth (UNIQUE (name, schema_version),
  plain reads, rename = one UPDATE with 23505 -> ErrTopicNameTaken);
  topic_log records a full snapshot (name, partition_size, config,
  declared_by = common.ProcessIdentity, declared_at) in the SAME
  transaction as every create, config replace, and rename (one row per
  schema_version). Machinery never reads it — the binding [0511]
  current-table-plus-trail shape, now one pattern across both.
- Supersedes [0519], whose truth-in-declarations build was completed,
  lab-verified, then rolled back uncommitted: newest-row lateral joins
  leaked into every reader and (name, schema_version) uniqueness went
  procedural with advisory locks on every name write. A single
  append-only table with a stable topic id was evaluated and rejected —
  a repeating id cannot be a foreign-key target.
- `_log` confirmed as the append-only-history suffix:
  binding_declaration renamed binding_log (index binding_log_group; Go
  surface BindingLogData/BindingLogStatus/ListBindingLog; Declare*
  verbs and declared_by/declared_at stay); the parked failure-evidence
  table becomes worker_run_log, reserving worker_log for worker
  metadata history (ROADMAP Next).
- registeridempotencylab now asserts the trail (1 row on create, none
  on a no-change register, 2 after a config change);
  destroysystemlab's table list gains topic_log. 41/41 fresh-DB labs,
  `just verify` green.

## 2026-08-21 — Stop line as session summary [0567][0568][0569]

- The consumer stopped line is the session summary: bound identity,
  `duration`, and ten `<verb>_count` counters (zeros printed), emitted
  on every exit including fatal-error teardown, memory only. Declared
  VK0041 with a trailing `help` attr ("metrics explained: vulkan
  explain VK0041"); the VK0041 page is the counter catalog.
- Counters are metrics machinery on the instance-side MetricsProducer:
  atomics bumped in the message/exception runners from facts in hand,
  Snapshot() renders the line, and one Run tick loop
  (ProducerConfig.SessionFlushRate, 30s default) flushes changed totals
  as KindCounter series (session-uuid attr, one session per Consume
  call) and drains the abandoned-event queue as one batch per tick.
- vulkan.consumer.session.* are first-class declarations in the shared
  VK registry (diagnostic.Metric, VK0042-51): the flusher builds
  measurements from the declarations, otelvulkan renders Description as
  Prometheus # HELP, and `vulkan explain` resolves a metric by code,
  full name, or stop-line attr key — ten hand-written pages plus the
  index rows (including drifted VK0038-41).
- VK0052 "abandoned-routine events dropped" reports both failed batches
  and queue-cap drops (counted at enqueue, reported next tick); the
  registry completeness walk now links pkg/consumer and pkg/metrics.

## 2026-08-21 — Slow-operation threshold logging [0566]

- One Warn line when an operation runs past its duration threshold, at
  the [0559] boundaries: every produce entry point, the per-delivery
  dispatch, the worker tick (threshold = the row's own poll_rate, no
  config). ProducerConfig.SlowProduceThreshold and ConsumerConfig.
  SlowDispatchThreshold opt in (0 = disabled); three declared events
  VK0038-40 with docs pages; attr registry rows duration/threshold.

## 2026-08-20 — Record pipeline + repeated-line suppression [0564][0565]

- logging.NewPipelineLogger(sink, cfg) is now the one wrapper: its config
  declares the composition (Args, Buffer, Suppress), building over an
  existing pipeline merges instead of nesting, and internally each call
  is a record walked through a one-method handler chain in one fixed
  order (capture -> enrich -> suppress -> drain -> sink) [0565].
  LoggerWith/BufferLogger and their wrapper types deleted; ~70 call
  sites declare their composition; ring and WithLogBuffer untouched.
- Producer, consumer, and system manager instances declare Suppress at
  construction: repeats of one (level, message) Warn/Error line inside a
  one-minute window collapse to the first line plus suppressed_count on
  the next emission [0564]; suppressed_count joined the attr registry.

## 2026-08-20 — Coded declarations get their own package [0563]

- pkg/common/diagnostic now owns the error anatomy, the log events, and
  their shared VK registry (registry.go / error.go / event.go); LogEvent
  renamed Event (diagnostic.Event, NewEvent, Events(), KindEvent). Domains
  declare via diagnostic.NewError/NewEvent; common root is vocabulary
  only, beside subpackages diagnostic and logging.

## 2026-08-20 — Log events carry VK codes [0562]

- common.NewLogEvent registers operator-actionable Warn/Error log events in
  the errors' VK serial space; 12 declarations (VK0026-VK0037) in
  consumergroup/worker/cron logs.go + producer datastore, call sites log
  the declared Message with the code as the first attr, hand-written docs
  pages on /errors/, `vulkan explain` lists both kinds, conventions walks
  extended. Consumer start line finishes [0558]'s snapshot rule with
  message_timeout/shutdown_timeout/batch_limit.

## 2026-08-20 — Logging machinery carved out to pkg/common/logging [0561]

- New infrastructure subpackage pkg/common/logging owns the Logger seam:
  Logger, LoggerWith, NewDefaultLogger, BufferLogger, WithLogBuffer, the
  debug-buffer ring; toAttrs stays unexported, duplicated per side.
  Narrows [0528]: errors/retry stay flat (stdlib shadow;
  MessageOptions↔Error cross-import). ~315 qualifier renames across 130
  files; CONVENTIONS.md infrastructure kind now reads "common and its
  machinery subpackages".

## 2026-08-20 — Logging rule sheet + debug buffer + SQL owner comments [0558][0559][0560]

- Logging conventions written and swept [0558]: CONVENTIONS.md `## Logging`
  (levels by "who must act", static messages under the problem-line grammar,
  attr key registry, identity bound once, start line = diagnosis snapshot,
  silent steady state, log-or-return-never-both); all 108 call sites
  reclassified/rekeyed/reworded; default logger stdout -> stderr and the
  ~40 copied Logger field comments resolved in one sweep; labs count log
  events by level+attrs (createaheadlab off message text).
- Per-operation debug buffer [0559]: common.WithLogBuffer +
  common.BufferLogger hold Debug/Info/Warn in a bounded per-ctx ring and
  drain it into the first Error record's `preceding` group attr; boundaries
  at Produce/ProduceBatch, CallSafely, and every worker tick; tick failure
  Warn escalates to Error past the TickRetry curve's cap.
- SQL literal owner comments [0560]: 185 literals now open with
  `-- vulkan: <package>.<method>`, attributing pg_stat_statements and
  server-log lines to library verbs at zero runtime cost.
- `vulkan explain [code]` renders any declared error condition offline from
  the registry; migrate's advisory-lock release now threads ctx and passes
  error values (LogValue intact). 41/41 fresh-DB labs, `just verify` green.

## 2026-08-20 — Plain-error standard + package-kinds restructure [0554][0555]

- Plain errors standardized [0554]: CONVENTIONS.md "When writing a plain
  error" (templates/banned words/tense apply below the declaration
  boundary; constraint guards end `, got <value>`; names spelled as the
  caller knows them; errors.New for static text; fix clauses under the
  fix rules; wrap only the owned fact). Swept: 33 got-clauses, 6 static
  fmt.Errorf, off-template rewordings, the VK0004 raise moved from
  fmt.Errorf prose to .With. cron.ErrDeclarationInterrupted VK0025
  declared (+docs page) — the third deleted-mid-declaration race, missed
  by 0553's audit, now Transient-healed like VK0021/VK0024.
- Package kinds [0555]: every package is infrastructure, a domain
  (vocabulary root ← controller ← datastore + the workers maintaining
  its tables), or an API package (producer, consumer, admin,
  systemmanager — no declared errors, no SQL, no vocabulary). Seam law:
  what another stack imports is a vocabulary root or domain controller;
  own-tree-only imports nest freely. Placement law: a worker lives under
  the domain whose tables it maintains.
- Moves: NEW pkg/consumergroup (VK0014–16, Group, binding types,
  MessageMeta; ex-consumer/controller as ConsumerGroupController; base,
  the three subconsumers, cursoradvancer); worker/janitor →
  topic/janitor; worker/cronscheduler → cron/scheduler;
  worker/metricscollector → metrics/collector; admin's VK0008/VK0009 →
  pkg/topic. The binding-declaration datastore now raises
  consumergroup.ErrGroupNotFound — the gap that started the redesign.
- "door" banned from the vocabulary; live occurrences reworded.
  schema-gate-lab's stale pre-VK0023 text checks moved onto errors.Is.
- Verified: build/vet/`go test -race` across all three modules;
  41/41 fresh-DB labs.
- Standing plain-error walks [0556]: internal/errorregistry now
  ast-walks every plain raise string (banned words, static fmt.Errorf,
  missing got-clauses, declared-problem restatement) — the audits'
  wording half is a ratchet, not a manual pass.
- Developer tooling isolated [0557]: dev-only tools/ module (6th go.work
  entry); errorregistry became tools/conventions — one package named for
  the document it enforces; `just verify` is the blessed pre-commit/CI
  command (all five modules build, walks run); internal/ holds only
  live code.

## 2026-08-19 — Structured error anatomy shipped [0550][0551][0552]

- common.Error (pkg/common/error.go): code + recovery + problem + fix +
  values (slog attrs) + wrapped cause. NewError registers each code at init
  and panics on structural mistakes (malformed/duplicate code, unrecognized
  recovery, empty problem); With/Wrap return copies so declared Err*
  variables stay immutable; Error() renders
  `problem: name value -- fix [code]: cause`; errors.Is identity = code;
  LogValue() renders the parts as JSON-log fields; Docs() derives the page
  URL from one base-URL const.
- 19 codes assigned (VK0001–VK0019); every named error variable declares
  via common.NewError; ~30 raise sites moved onto .With value pairs;
  remaining plain validation errors swept onto the CONVENTIONS templates
  (enum Validates enumerate every legal value). A missing `__system.*`
  topic raises migrate.ErrNotRegistered everywhere [0552].
- Retry classification is consulted, never encoded [0551]: retry_error.go
  (marker types) and retry.go deleted; RetryDatastore is the one retry
  type; IsTransientDatastoreError (recovery first, then IsTransientPgError)
  is the one check; datastore errors surface unwrapped.
- CLI: renderErrorBlock is the single renderer for structured errors
  (aligned block: header + values/cause/retry-when-Transient/fix/docs);
  cliFixes rewrites a code's fix to a pasteable vulkan command (VK0017 →
  `vulkan migrate init`). `--output json` deferred to ROADMAP Later.
- internal/errorregistry: registry-wide tense + banned-word walks plus a
  source-scan completeness test that fails when a declaring package is
  missing from the import list. 19 hand-owned docs pages seeded under
  website/src/content/docs/errors/ (one per code, titled by the verbatim
  problem text; auto-generation rejected — convention + parked CI drift
  check keep them honest).
- Verified: 41/41 fresh-DB labs; all modules build; go test -race green.
- Same-day follow-on [0553]: the declaration boundary codified in
  CONVENTIONS ## Errors (cross-package brancher / recovery override /
  docs-worthy condition; validation and same-package signals stay plain),
  then a full audit of all ~618 raise sites: five promotions
  (VK0020 topic partitions remain; VK0021/VK0024 topic/worker
  declaration-interrupted races, Transient so DatastoreRetry heals them;
  VK0022/VK0023 schema version skew) and two topic-not-registered prose
  duplicates folded into ErrTopicNotFound. Five hand-written docs pages;
  affected labs green (register-idempotency, destroy-system,
  schema-evolution, consumergroup).

## 2026-08-19 — Definition/Provisioner split [0549]

- worker.Definition became a data struct (Name, Metadata, OwnerKind with
  "" = any kind, TargetInstances with 0 -> 1); the concrete machines are
  *XProvisioner, each building and storing its Definition at construction.
- Provisioner interface: Definition() replaces Name();
  Provision(ctx, declared *worker.Worker) replaces the id/owner/metadata
  triple -- the worker row is the declared form of the definition.
- One WorkerController.DeclareWorker(definition, owner) verb ends every
  Declare: 8 kinds' Declare collapsed to one-liners (consumers inherit it
  from BaseProvisioner, which stamps NoInstanceTarget as a base invariant);
  the alerts keep their group/binding preamble; the Declarer+Provisioner
  bundle interface is deleted. Declare returns only error -- provisioning
  re-reads the row so the newest declaration wins.
- 41/41 fresh-DB labs green; all five modules build, vet and -race clean.

## 2026-08-19 — Naming pass [0545][0546][0547][0548]

- Waterline retired [0545]: pkg/worker/waterline -> pkg/worker/cursoradvancer
  (worker name 'cursor_advancer'), AdvanceWaterline -> AdvanceCommitted,
  RollRetry -> AdvanceRetry; comments, labs, CLI help, and the justfile
  describe cursor.committed directly. reference/, bench/, and doc history
  keep the old word.
- Controller + datastore verbs dropped their own noun [0546] across Topic,
  CronJob, System, Compaction, KeyLease, CronScheduler, and
  ExceptionConsumer (now symmetric with DeliveryConsumer's bare Record*
  verbs); multi-noun controllers and the MessageAdmin facade keep theirs,
  each for a recorded reason.
- Run-side worker structs renamed *Instance [0547] (execution.go ->
  instance.go, manager pool -> instancePool/spawnedInstance);
  worker.Execution survives only as the interface name; the concrete
  Definition/Provisioner split was rejected -- a data-only definition has
  no consumer.
- Receiver letter codified as the type's final-word initial [0548]
  (CONVENTIONS.md amended); mechanical sweep: truncated names spelled out
  (sched, op, n, g, prev, idx, opts, msg; min/max builtin shadowing fixed),
  withMetadata moved into consumer_config.go x3, claimBuffer/rangeState/
  batchResponse/createAheadGate members unexported, cronscheduler's
  nine-column SELECT wrapped one per line.
- 41/41 fresh-DB labs green; root, cmd/vulkan, otelvulkan, examples, and
  bench modules all build; vet and -race clean.

## 2026-08-19 — Config & options refinement [0542][0543][0544]

- Shape decisions [0542]: Config keeps its name, backed by a new
  CONVENTIONS.md rule (Config = only optional fields; required values are
  constructor params — PostgresConnectionConfig's User/Host/Database moved
  into NewPostgresDatastore's signature); ProduceOptions compaction nested
  as Compaction *CompactionOptions{Key, Rank} built via
  NewCompactionOptions (nil = not compacted, rank-without-key
  unrepresentable); Consumer.Register keeps its five params and
  NewConsumerInstance unexported.
- Field grouping [0543]: config field order standardized domain-first with
  the ambient tail (Logger, Retry, per-loop retry curves) and codified;
  six drifted configs reordered (ConsumerConfig worst); cron_job.suspended
  and delivery's outcome-state/lease DDL columns regrouped; the two lease
  `RETURNING *` statements now name their columns.
- Dead-field pass [0544]: WorkerSnapshot.OldestInstanceAge chain and
  WorkerInstanceData.ExpiresAt deleted; JobRequest.CronJobId exempted as
  wire-payload contract; staticcheck + unparam clean across all three
  code modules.
- Verified by build/vet/race tests per change, targeted labs per chunk,
  and the full fresh-DB suite at close: 41/41.

## 2026-08-19 — examples/bench/reference split into dev-only nested modules [0541]

- Each tree got its own go.mod on the cmd/vulkan / otelvulkan pattern (no
  parent require; go.work resolves) but is never tagged or published — the
  release story stays three modules.
- Published module zip now carries the library only; root `go test ./...`
  dropped reference/waterline's tests. justfile lab recipes unchanged —
  `go run examples/phase_1/...` resolves through the workspace.
- The premise behind the roadmap's go.mod-cleanup follow-up was measured
  empty (root tidy is a no-op — pkg/ needs all three direct deps), so that
  item was dropped rather than carried.

## 2026-08-19 — Worker-tier surface review (Phase-13 rigor) [0540]

- Every surface the worker tier exports reviewed: pkg/worker vocabulary,
  pkg/worker/controller, the five worker kinds + manager Runner,
  pkg/systemmanager, the consumer split + consumer/base, pkg/producer, and
  the `vulkan manager` CLI. Verified by build/vet/race tests +
  metrics-lab + routing-lab.
- Shape fixes: Worker.Owner became *common.Owner (the lone by-value Owner);
  RegisterInstance's free-func-taking-the-controller became a
  WorkerController method (9 call sites); janitor's Provision validates
  owner before its pre-claim topic resolution (nil-owner panic);
  NewProducerInstance nil-checks cfg.
- The planted trap settled [0540]: bare sub-consumer constructors fenced
  by package/constructor docs (one worker row, not the assembled group;
  consumer.NewConsumer is the path), no signature change. Package comments
  sit below the package clause -- now a CONVENTIONS.md File layout rule.
- Text fixes: stale "first tick is uniform" comment deleted from all four
  kind configs; stale "pass" param name in InstanceTickRunner; in-code
  struct{}-vs-generics TODO deleted (ROADMAP owns it); stale MetadataValue
  mentions removed. No major readability debt surfaced beyond the
  convention sweep's fixes.

## 2026-08-19 — File-layout + blank-line conventions written and swept; LIFECYCLE demoted [0538][0539]

- LIFECYCLE left the public door: ConsumerType/CURSOR/LIFECYCLE,
  ConsumerConfig.Type and FanOutBatchLimit deleted, NewConsumer always
  builds the cursor path; deliveryconsumer is reachable only by direct
  import and carries an ON HOLD package doc. internal/ moves deferred.
- CONVENTIONS.md gained File layout [0538] (free vars/consts top, type
  block struct/New/validates, pair-by-pair or lifecycle order, unexported
  non-constructor free funcs at bottom behind the HELPERS banner) and
  Blank lines [0539] (bodies read as paragraphs: one blank between steps,
  glue rules, comments bind downward, switch/select arms stay dense).
- Rule-by-rule project-wide sweep (user-settled cadence): hygiene blanks,
  SQL-literal/exec glue (19), comment binding (45), validation preambles
  (17), paragraph steps (39), helpers moved behind banners in 29 files,
  constructor-before-methods fix; pair adjacency scanned clean. Verified
  by build/vet/race tests plus routing-lab; vendored cron and labs
  excluded by scope.

## 2026-08-18 — Layered-pattern chunk queue swept (pre-v1 cleanup) [0526]-[0537]

- The pkg-wide CONVENTIONS audit's chunk queue (expanded 2026-08-17 from
  ROADMAP) ran to empty over two days; 41/41 fresh-DB labs at close.
- Structure: migrate became a doored three-layer domain [0526][0527];
  logger/retry/errors/context merged into flat pkg/common [0528];
  compaction recorded as the deliberate two-layer exception (MessageRow is
  cross-stack vocabulary in common) [0530]; system-topic and cron-job
  declarations moved to their domains' controllers (topic_config.go)
  [0531]; consumer read-models live with the controller whose verbs return
  them [0532]; the metrics write door became pkg/metrics/producer
  (MetricsProducer, consumer/metrics deleted) [0534];
  consumer/base got pure constructors, BaseConsumerConfig /
  BaseDefinitionConfig, and symmetric ClaimKeyedRun/ReleaseKeyedRun
  [0535]; every worker kind carries a controller [0537].
- Rules settled: field absence is the zero value, never a nil pointer
  [0533], with MessageOptions the sanctioned nilable sparse sub-document
  [0536]; exported header-block fields (Config/Logger) are the standard;
  i* aliases for machinery-name collisions.
- Terminology sweeps: "park" family (~50 sites incl. parkStatement/parked
  CTE) and "ack" (AckMargin -> RecordMargin) replaced with the codebase's
  literal actions.

- datastore.Querier widened to the one statement contract
  (Exec/Query/QueryRow/SendBatch/CopyFrom — what pool, conn, and tx can all
  do minus transaction control); producer Tx = { Querier; Raw() pgx.Tx };
  the produce transaction is the one sanctioned package crossing, and
  cronscheduler produces through the producer's public InTransaction seam.
  pgx.Tx survives only in Begin-owning privates and the Tx adapter [0529].
- Every worker kind now carries a controller layer over its datastore:
  janitor, waterline, and cronscheduler grew controllers matching the alert
  kinds; executions call them; AdvanceWaterline's two-statement
  non-transactional advance reconfirmed and stated [0537].
- The Querier-interface ROADMAP item closed with this work.

## 2026-08-16 — Multi-message Produce [0525]

- ProducerInstance gained ProduceBatch(ctx, items...): every item in one
  transaction, none land unless all do, results in argument order, a
  failure named as "item N". ProduceItem{Message, Options} via
  NewProduceItem, which rejects a caller IdempotencyKey — one hot key
  would stall the batch's shared transaction, so keyed messages stay on
  Produce. No new write path: it drives controller.AppendMessageBatch (the
  batcher's flush verb); a private toAppend adapter fills options and
  generates the fresh v7 the datastore's ambiguous-commit rerun dedups on.
  Nothing dedups across calls, exactly as with unkeyed Produce.
- Dogfooded: collectConsumerGroup and both alert produceCheckSummary
  methods replaced their errgroup fan-outs with one ProduceBatch call each.
- producer-batch-lab's new produceBatchScenario proves the contract: 30
  items under a single xmin, ids ascending in argument order, a
  jsonb-poisoned item rolling the whole batch back with "item 2" in the
  error, caller-key and empty-batch rejections. Fresh-DB suite 36/36.

## 2026-08-16 — Alert pipeline instrumented [0524]

- The metrics collector's pass gained collectAlerts: fleet-level
  vulkan.alert.state.active_alerts / resolved_alerts gauges counted from
  the __system.alerts compaction heads, nil attributes, always produced.
  Per-name or per-severity series were rejected -- they would be enumerated
  from the heads themselves and go stale when heads sweep out of retention
  or a severity transitions.
- AlertController.Record returns RecordOutcome (active | resolved |
  nothing) beside its error, so a handler counts what its run did without
  a second head read.
- Both alert executions produce a per-run vulkan.alert.check.* summary --
  topics_evaluated / topics_failed / published_alerts / resolved_alerts,
  attribute alert=<name> -- at the end of every run INCLUDING failed ones,
  so a run that failed 1 of 9 topics no longer looks like a total failure.
  Head = latest run, retained log = one row per run; no cumulative counter
  state. The four produces run concurrently on one instance to share the
  producer's batched transactions; a failed summary produce joins the
  run's error.
- alertlab asserts the outcome of every classify arm and the summary after
  each executor run (including topics_failed = 1 on the corrupted-head
  run); metricscollectorlab's coverage set gained the state gauges.
  Fresh-DB suite 36/36.

## 2026-08-16 — Metrics collection and otel exposure [0522] [0523]

- pkg/metrics gained the measurement vocabulary: Measurement (name, kind,
  value, unit, attributes, at) — [0523] renamed the point type from Sample —
  plus the Metric* name consts under the reserved "vulkan." prefix,
  NewMeasurement and MeasurementKey. Measurements land on __system.metrics
  keyed by MeasurementKey(name, attributes), so compaction heads are the
  current value per series and the retained log is its history.
- pkg/worker/metricscollector: a system-scope worker on the cronscheduler
  template, declared at RegisterSystem and provisioned by SystemManager and
  every embedded consumer manager. Each pass at the row's poll_rate (default
  30s) produces fleet worker/cron measurements, then snapshots topics
  concurrently under TopicConcurrency with each group's measurements
  produced concurrently so the producer's batcher collapses them into shared
  transactions; __system.metrics itself is skipped by name.
- Reads: ListCompactionKeyMessages on CompactionController (the one new core
  verb), admin ListMeasurements / ListMeasurementMessages, and the CLI's
  `vulkan metrics list` / `vulkan metrics get`.
- otelvulkan nested module — core dropped its otel/prometheus deps outright
  (pkg/metrics/metrics deleted; release tagging is now a three-module
  story). Metrics registers an instrument per metric name on one meter
  (yours, or the global provider's by default); Exporter owns a private
  Metrics whose provider's only reader is the otel Prometheus reader and
  serves /metrics, registering names that appeared since the last scrape;
  MetricsProducer / MetricsConsumer publish and read user measurements on
  the same topic, with the reserved prefix rejected at Produce.
- `vulkan manager run --metrics-address` serves /metrics beside the manager,
  failing fast if the system isn't registered. metricscollectorlab drives
  collector -> topic -> admin reads -> a scraped manager subprocess under
  -race; fresh-DB suite 36/36.

## 2026-08-15 — Config becomes code-owned [0518] [0520] [0521]

- Config is declared in code and the latest declaration wins. RegisterTopic,
  RegisterCronJob and RegisterWorker (renamed from InsertWorker, since it
  creates-or-takes the declaration like every other register) each write their
  declared mutable config onto the row they find. All three report the same
  three outcomes at Info -- created, already existed, config replaced -- and
  the replaced line carries `field="old -> new"` for each field that actually
  moved, which is how two services declaring one thing differently gets found.
  Topic and cron do it in their datastore's `replace.go`; the worker's UPDATE
  returns both sides of its metadata through a self-join on the pre-SET row.
- A destroy racing a declaration is an error in all three paths, not a silent
  nil: the topic and cron registers used to return `(nil, nil)`, which their
  controllers dereferenced.
- Deleted: AlterTopic, AlterGroup, AlterWorker(s), AlterCronJob, their
  Alter*Config/Alter*Data types and to* adapters, UpdateTopic, UpdateCronJob,
  MetadataValue with applyOverrides/mergeMetadata/declaresKey,
  pkg/common/update.go, ErrCronJobConfigMismatch, and `topic config
  set|unset` / `group config set|unset`. Both `config get`s stay.
- Worker metadata is the plain typed value per key -- each kind's metadata
  struct holds a `time.Duration` / `int` / `common.MessageOptions` directly,
  and the stored JSONB flattens from `{"poll_rate":{"default":N}}` to
  `{"poll_rate":N}`. [0516]'s repeat_interval lands as one of those fields.
- Identity and action state are not config: partition_size still raises
  ErrTopicConfigMismatch, a cron job's owner columns are written at creation
  only, and both `suspended` and `target_instances = 0` survive a
  redeclaration -- SuspendCronJob/UnsuspendCronJob are what change the former.
- The CLI creates nothing ([0521]): `vulkan topic register` and `vulkan cron
  register` are deleted, matching `vulkan system`, which never had one, and
  cmd/vulkan/README.md says where topics and cron jobs come from instead.
- New surface in the same sweep ([0520]): a JobConfig (Schedule, Threshold)
  per built-in alert, composed into admin.RegisterSystemConfig, which
  RegisterSystem now takes; ensureSystemCronJob and ensureSystemTopic
  collapsed into ordinary register calls.
- Labs: the producer/consumer stand-ins (consumer, bench, variance, crashlab)
  resolve their topic with GetTopic and exit with a clear message when it
  isn't registered; registeridempotencylab, idempotencykeyslab, cronlab,
  alertlab and reservedtopiclab assert the newest declaration wins; topiclab's
  partition proofs wait for create-ahead's partition instead of racing it.

## 2026-08-15 — Destroy system [0514]

- `admin.DestroySystem` completes the destroy-verb set (topic, group,
  system): RegisterSystem's inverse, deleting every registered topic through
  the existing `DeleteTopic` path, then dropping the shared control-plane
  tables in one transaction under the register's own advisory lock.
- Guards unless Force: any live worker instance -> `system.ErrSystemLive`;
  any non-`__system.` topic -> `system.ErrTopicsRegistered` (Force takes
  user topics and their messages too).
- `vulkan system destroy` with --force/--yes; the confirmation phrase is the
  connected database's name (`current_database()`).
- destroysystemlab covers both guards (worker guard outranks topic guard),
  the clean teardown of all 13 tables, and re-registering afterward.

## 2026-08-14 — Producer proactive partition create-ahead [0512] [0513]

- Append paths create the next partition early: an appended id (or batch
  range) landing on a partition's trigger point (80%, 95% backstop —
  `CreateAheadGate`) wins a per-topic monotonic CAS claim and runs
  `ensureCoveringPartition` in a detached goroutine. Best-effort by design:
  warn-and-drop, the boundary heal stays the only correctness layer. One id
  sequence means exactly one append fleet-wide sees each trigger id — zero
  coordination.
- The heal path's thundering herd is capped: a blocking
  `pg_advisory_xact_lock` under the existing 2s lock_timeout means one
  winner runs the CREATE and losers wake after its commit to a no-op.
- The detached run's timeout derives from the retry policy (new
  `Policy.CalculateTotalDelay` + per-attempt allowance); lock_timeout
  expiries reclassify as retryable on this path only; a destroyed topic
  evicts its gate entry on undefined_table. `TopicConfig.Validate` gained a
  `PartitionSize >= 2` floor.
- createaheadlab proves all three append paths create ahead of the boundary
  (partition exists before it, zero heal warns, contiguous ids);
  partitionlab reshaped onto deterministic create-ahead polling.

## 2026-08-13 — Binding lifecycle: sets declared at consumer Register [0511]

- `Consumer.Register(ctx, group, topic, version, bindings)` states the
  group's full binding set (nil = whole topic). Consume re-attempts the
  declaration until installed or joined before starting the manager; a
  waiting outcome (a live instance still declares a different set) retries
  every `ConsumerConfig.BindingRetryInterval` with a Warn per attempt,
  forever — never fencing the incumbent.
- Storage is the append-only `binding_declaration` table, one row per
  attempt: effective set = the group's newest installed row, a declarer's
  newest waiting row is its retry heartbeat; `declared_at` (episode start)
  + `attempt_at` per row; concurrent installers serialize on the
  consumer_group row lock; claims keep reading `binding` rows, swapped only
  inside the install transaction. Declarer identity is
  `common.ProcessIdentity` (hostname:pid:random, once per process).
- The create-only path is gone: ConsumerController.Bind/ClearBindings and
  their datastore pairs deleted. Alert `Declare` states {JobName} through
  DeclareBindings at RegisterSystem — an undeclared group reads as
  whole-topic, which had `cron get --requests`-style listings matching every
  job.
- Read surface: `MessageAdmin.ListDeclarations` returns
  `binding.Declaration` rows (each group's effective declaration plus open
  waiters); `vulkan alert bindings` shows status/patterns/declarer/
  timestamps. The per-pattern ListBindings listing was deleted.
- New bindinglab (`just binding-lab`): same-set join, divergent wait against
  a live incumbent, dead-fleet swap ending in consumption under the new
  set. Six labs moved from Bind onto DeclareBindings. 40/40 fresh-DB suite.

## 2026-08-13 — Lab binaries build into bin/

- `just build-lab <lab>` compiles a lab's main.go to `bin/<lab>`; `bin/*` is
  gitignored except `.gitkeep`.
- The per-binary .gitignore entries (`reclaimlab`, `routinglab`) and the two
  stray compiled binaries at repo root were removed; the bench projector
  binary followed, and .gitignore's enumerated bench/idempotency scratch list
  collapsed to `bench/idempotency/*` + `!RESULTS.md`.
- conventions.md renamed CONVENTIONS.md to match the doc naming pattern.

## 2026-08-13 — Record-keeping surface redesign

- LEARNING_PLAN.md/TODO.md/NOTES.md reorganized into docs/: ROADMAP.md
  (future, Now/Next/Later/Parking lot), TODO.md (in-flight sliding window
  only), this ledger, and per-decision records in docs/decisions/ with
  docs/DECISIONS.md as the retrieval index. TEST.md moved along with them;
  only the rule files stay at repo root.
- The decision history was distilled out of the phase notes: ~250 records
  covering phases 1 through 14a.
- LEARNING_PLAN.md and NOTES.md deleted (full files in git history) after
  archiving the user's Explain-it-back answers verbatim to
  docs/archive/explain-it-back.md — both the NOTES.md sections and the 42
  answers written inside LEARNING_PLAN.md itself.

## 2026-08-13 — 14a (alerts): default alert checks & the 14a gate

- Default checks (`partition_count`, `compaction_read_cost`) shipped as cron
  jobs with per-check worker-kind subpackages; one consumer group per check
  bound to its exact job name, the central dispatcher killed for good
  [0481][0482].
- The compacted `__system.alerts` topic is the state store, dedup memory,
  integration surface, and — via the repeat republish — its own retention
  keepalive [0483].
- Transitions decided by the pure `classify(found, head, repeat, now)`;
  evidence rides the alert but never enters the decision [0484].
- No notifier component: WARN/INFO edges are a side effect of
  `AlertController.Record` comparing the publish against the head, making the
  pipeline restart-proof and idempotent [0485][0488].
- Executors are worker definitions the manager claims (goroutine hosting
  rebuilt away); each check's Evaluate condition lives once in its controller
  and is injected into producer and consumer [0486][0487].
- Checks self-declare at `RegisterSystem` with schema-level idempotent binds;
  the register-time evaluator pass is log-only, leaving `Record` the single
  writer to alert state [0489][0490].
- Gate swept same day: `MessageAdmin.DestroyGroup` + `vulkan group destroy`,
  `vulkan alert bindings`, GroupLag.ParkedExceptions renamed
  UnresolvedExceptions, 35/35 fresh-DB labs green, `git tag phase-14a`.

## 2026-08-12 — 14a (cron): cron_job scheduler & job_requests

- Scheduled work built on the existing messaging machinery: `cron_job` spec
  rows, a `cronscheduler` worker producing per-job requests onto one
  compacted `__system.job_requests` topic, consumers binding job names as
  routing keys [0461][0462].
- Concurrency stamped into MessageOptions and enforced only at consume time
  by the key lease; the scheduler drops missed times, walking to the newest
  due time per job [0463][0464].
- Job-request status is fully derived — no status column — from message_log,
  compaction_head, and delivery_log in mode 'all', with terminal outcomes
  classified before not-head "superseded" [0465][0466][0467].
- Registry verbs (idempotent register, altering re-seeds the due time, gated
  destroy) with a vendored robfig schedule core; the scheduler commits one
  transaction per row so a poisoned job cannot stall its siblings
  [0468][0469][0470].
- `RunCronJob` takes a fresh v7 idempotency key per call and defaults to
  'allow'; "firing" retired from the vocabulary codebase-wide [0471][0472].
- Status/listing datastore reads decomposed from one CTE statement into flat
  per-fact queries composed in Go, deliberately trading away single-snapshot
  consistency [0473].

## 2026-08-08 — 14a (worker system): worker/worker_instance & the manager

- One generic worker/worker_instance pair replaced all per-feature
  maintenance/duty plumbing: a worker row is the spec, an instance row is a
  heartbeat-held lease, and suspend is target_instances = 0 [0421];
  exclusivity moved from claim-per-tick to claim-per-instance, trading
  failover latency for once-per-lifetime arbitration [0422].
- The manager runs one reconcile loop, respawning only on ErrInstanceLost and
  propagating every other error [0423]; the consumer inversion made the
  consumption loops ordinary worker rows and the public Consumer a seeding
  construct over a manager runner [0424], with self-claimed loops marked
  NoInstanceTarget (-1) [0430].
- The daemon (`vulkan manager run`) is the same manager claiming one system
  manager row; deployment scope is a single WHERE clause and topic manager
  rows were deleted [0425]; the umbrella package was named systemmanager
  after researching comparable systems [0431].
- The producer split into pure factory + stateless Register(ctx, topic,
  version); the stored lifecycleCtx and its shutdown error family were
  deleted [0426].
- WorkerSnapshot/CronJobSnapshot verdicts became classify functions with a
  flat 10m overdue threshold [0427].
- The migration was built beside pkg/maintain and switched over, never
  hybridized [0429]; the final cleanup deleted EnsureNextPartition without a
  rehome — partition creation belongs to the write path, the janitor is
  cleanup only [0428].

## 2026-08-06 — 14a (schema evolution): epoch-versioned topics

- A breaking message-schema change is now a new physical topic under the same
  name — `topic (name, schema_version)` UNIQUE, all lifecycle verbs
  version-addressed, `SchemaVersion` a required positional constructor param,
  and no unversioned `GetTopic` [0401][0405][0409].
- Compaction's winner rule generalized to a signed caller-supplied rank
  compared before id — `CompactionRank` on `message_log` and
  `compaction_head` with a native row-compare guard — so a bridge writing at
  rank −1 can never overwrite a live rank-0 write [0403].
- Migrating a compacted topic is deliberately user-space: the bridge consumer
  pattern, built on `consumer.MetaFromContext` message metadata and
  source-id-derived idempotency keys for crash-safe resume [0402][0404][0407].
- `FamilyHealth` telegraphs when an old version can retire but never calls a
  compacted topic safe; it lives in `pkg/admin` as `DestroyTopic`'s own
  question, a built `pkg/metrics.HealthMetrics` having been reverted
  [0406][0411].
- Naming settled: the catalog column stays `schema_version` despite the
  `schema_log` overlap, and topic identity in logs/metrics stays two
  structured fields, never `name@vN` [0408][0410].

## 2026-08-04 — 14a (consumer layering): the layered package pattern

- The three-layer shape (pkg/<x> vocabulary, controller as the only door,
  table-exact datastore, import arrows strictly down) became the house
  standard and was rolled across worker, topic, system, consumer, metrics,
  and cron [0441], with all input validation at the controller and trusting
  datastores [0442].
- pkg/consumer converted around one non-negotiable symbol:
  consumer.NewConsumer stays put, so pkg/consumer is a door with read-models
  in the controller, sorted by "nothing a user types lives below the door"
  [0443]; the consumption loops became packages with narrow configs,
  duplication accepted [0444].
- MessageMeta forced the single new leaf pkg/consumer/message, because its
  unexported ctx key cannot be duplicated per package [0445].
- Cleanups carried with the conversion: the phantom ConsumerDatastore type
  parameter deleted [0446]; uuid.UUID above the datastore, pgtype.UUID below,
  ErrLeaseLost declared at its detection site [0447].
- No shared base package at first (~150 lines copied per loop) — since
  superseded by pkg/consumer/base [0448]; deliveryconsumer was kept unrun
  rather than deleted [0449]; rangeState/claimBuffer stayed private to
  protect atomic write ordering [0450]; the house name stutter stays until
  the v1 API review [0451].

## 2026-08-01 — Phase 14: v1 hardening & correctness fixes

- `topic.Destroy` no longer exhausts Postgres's shared lock table: partitions
  drain in fixed 100-per-transaction batches of plain `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS`
  (no DETACH), crash-resumable and bounded against live producers
  [0381][0382][0383][0384].
- Two live cursor-claim races proven and closed: a READ
  COMMITTED/EvalPlanQual double-delivery race via `FOR UPDATE` on the
  old_values read, and permanent message loss from late-committing producers
  via the snapshot fence — claims stop at a proven head, with unconditional
  pending-pair storage and an idle short-circuit [0388][0394][0395][0396]; a
  missing cursor row now errors loudly instead of reading as "caught up," via
  a query restructure that also came out 25-30% faster at high partition
  counts [0387].
- FanOut moved from full-log rescans to a hardened per-group mark on the
  cursor table: LIFECYCLE groups register cursor rows and pin retention,
  delivery runs eagerly past the proven head, and binding changes are
  forward-only [0389][0390][0391][0392][0393].
- The abandoned-routines map stays deliberately unbounded; its real leak — an
  Add/Remove ordering race — was fixed structurally with a reaper goroutine
  [0385][0386].
- Written decisions closing standing questions: no deliveries status index
  for v1 (reopen only on measured evidence, partial index preferred) [0397];
  no DELETE CASCADEs or triggers — visible DML over schema-resident behavior
  [0398]; `Process` claim errors stay per-tick fatal [0399].
- SQLSTATE retry classification hardened: connection-death and
  ambiguous-commit codes became retryable after a ~21-site retry-safety
  audit, with resource-exhaustion, corruption, and misconfiguration codes
  explicitly excluded [0400].

## 2026-08-01 — Phase 13: public API design review (v1 gate)

- Painstaking pre-v1 pass over everything exported from producer, consumer,
  and topic: every item got an explicit written decision, with anything
  API-shape-affecting pulled forward before the shape froze.
- Producers and consumers got a shared registration lifecycle: Register(ctx)
  with fail-fast topic-handle validation [0363], once-per-instance
  registration and shared sentinels [0365], merged session ctxs with
  nil-on-wind-down [0366], and a deleted shutdown hook in favor of app-owned
  datastore Close [0368] — the producer's ctx capture itself was later
  dropped [0361].
- Vocabulary and placement settled: the generic became Message with cascading
  type renames [0369], table-name plumbing moved to internal/topic [0371],
  janitor/partition tuning became persisted topic-row state [0372], and
  QueueTimeout became QueueMargin [0373].
- Retry got one mental model — retry.Policy carried per config [0374], reused
  for exception backoff [0375] — and validation moved to construction via the
  library-wide WithDefaults-then-Validate convention [0377].
- PartitionSafetyBuffer was deleted for unconditional one-ahead partition
  creation [0378] with multi-partition premake explicitly rejected [0379];
  the dead datastore interfaces were collapsed to concrete types [0380];
  migrations became admin.MigrateTopic/MigrateSystem calls [0501].
- The circuit breaker's full two-tier design was settled at feature level for
  a later build [0502-0506], and the public surface was trimmed to three
  audiences with concurrency, low-level retry, and ConsumerType demoted
  [0507-0510].

## 2026-07-20 — Phase 11.5: admin surface, migrations-into-code & CLI
(built incrementally across July 2026; no phase tag [0356])

- pkg/migrate: schema as versioned Go with runner-owned transaction
  boundaries; golang-migrate deleted, RegisterSystem's idempotent baseline is
  bootstrap [0341][0342].
- schema_log with latest-by-id current-version rule, independent system/topic
  version counters, and one advisory lock with session- vs xact-scoped
  hold-times [0343][0344][0345].
- Explicit migration registries with contiguity tests plus teaching-error
  gates (ErrNotRegistered, AssertSchemaSupported, translateAdminError)
  [0346][0347].
- pkg/admin.MessageAdmin: register/get/list/alter/rename/destroy + migrate
  verbs; AlterTopic as a pointer patch over a static COALESCE UPDATE,
  PartitionSize immutable by omission, id-keyed rename as its own verb
  [0348][0349][0350][0351][0352].
- delivery_log_<id> now always created, DisableDeliveryLog gates writes only
  [0353].
- cmd/vulkan as a nested-module CLI (cobra/fang/lipgloss, gitignored go.work)
  with sparse flags mapped via Flags().Changed; topic and migrate command
  trees [0354][0355].

## 2026-07-16 — Phase 11: architecture cleanup — datastore boundary & producer API

- Multi-target transactional enqueue: producer.InTransaction +
  WorkProducer.ProduceInTx, per-target SAVEPOINT partition self-heal with no
  opt-out, no auto-retry [0321][0322][0323].
- Attempt audit trail: per-topic delivery_log recording failed attempts only,
  written in the same transaction as the delivery mutation; deliveries made
  per-topic and the six shared tables singularized first [0324][0325].
- context.WithTimeoutCause at all three nested-timeout sites, naming which
  budget fired [0326].
- Commit/PartialCommit exception writes collapsed to one pgx.Batch — 3.16ms
  at N=1 to 9.3ms at N=1000; RecordException left unbatched for durability
  [0327].
- Datastore boundary audit: one pgtype.UUID leak, constructors found to
  bypass the interface entirely; keep/simplify/remove deferred to a standing
  cleanup phase [0328].

## 2026-07-14 — Phase 10: observability — logging, queue-state metrics & OTel

- Pluggable logger interface with an io.Writer-backed default implementation
  [0304].
- One queue-state datastore query per (group, topic) — backlog,
  claimed-committed inflight gap, ready/inflight/dead exception counts,
  oldest-unacked age, open leases — generalizing the ad hoc `just lag`
  recipe [0305].
- Metrics snapshot merging that query with the in-process AbandonedRoutines
  counters; the debug readout and OTel instruments both read only the
  snapshot [0303].
- OTel integration on the metric API package only, no-op provider by default;
  all 13 instruments verified on a scraped Prometheus body in otel-export-lab
  [0302].
- Lazy-vs-synchronous waterline rollup measured and resolved: stayed lazy
  (synchronous was 1.3x-1.9x slower at 20 committers), added
  WaterlinePollRate [0301].
- Three labs: metrics-reaction-lab (each failure shape moves exactly its
  numbers), metrics-load-lab (15.6x catch-up cut at a fast poll rate),
  otel-export-lab.

## 2026-07-12 — Phase 9: consumer fault isolation & recovery

- Panics, hangs, and datastore blips in `consumerFunc` now all land in the
  same per-message retry/backoff/dead-letter path as an ordinary error — one
  message affected, never the whole claimed range [0281].
- One shared `callSafely` wraps `consumerFunc` for all three claim paths:
  `recover()` inside the spawned goroutine converts panics to errors sent on
  `done`, raced against `WorkTimeout + WorkTimeoutGrace` (default 100ms,
  sized from measured p99 <1ms scheduler wakeup) [0287][0288][0289][0291].
- Abandoned timed-out goroutines are tracked in a mutex-guarded registry
  keyed by `(MessageId, Attempt)`, kept as plain in-process state ahead of
  any metrics-library commitment [0292][0293].
- `pkg/retry` (explicit retryable/permanent classification, public/private
  datastore split) made blips survivable; the `idempotency_key` claim table
  closed the resulting double-publish-on-ambiguous-ack gap, its measured cost
  cut with a batched CTE plus `SkipIdempotency`, which in turn moved
  `Commit()` classification inline at call sites [0282][0283][0284][0285].
- Graceful shutdown narrows an interrupted lease via `PartialCommit` so the
  unprocessed suffix rides the existing crash-recovery reclaim path [0286].
- The fault-isolation lab caught a live `retry.Wrap` bug —
  success-after-retries returned as a joined error — fixed with a plain nil
  early-return [0294].

## 2026-07-11 — 8c: log compaction, latest-per-key filtered at claim time

- Compacted topics ship with an append-only log: superseded rows stay
  physically present and `readMessages`/`FanOut` filter to the current latest
  row per `compaction_key`, so retention is disk cleanup, never a correctness
  gate [0261].
- The filter predicate is unbounded — re-checked live on every read including
  reclaims — after a crash/reclaim race proved a claim-high-bounded check
  could drop a superseded key's delivery entirely [0263].
- `latest_key(topic_id, compaction_key, latest_id)`, one shared table
  upserted in the producing transaction with an id-value guard, replaced the
  correlated scan with an O(1) lookup; the old scan and its partial index
  were deleted outright [0262][0267][0268][0272].
- Both sides of the tradeoff were measured, not assumed: the scan is linear
  at ~10µs/partition (extrapolating to ~1s per surviving key at 100K
  partitions), the upsert is noise uncontended and 2.5-2.9x slower on a
  single hot key [0271][0273].
- Retention janitors stay compaction-unaware — a dormant key aging out is
  intentional — and garbage-collect the dangling `latest_key` row via each
  function's existing deliveries-cleanup pattern [0269].
- No schema-level tombstone (deletion lives in the payload) and no history
  backfill (built, verified live, reverted — no deployment predates the
  table) [0266][0270].

## 2026-07-10 — 8b: per-topic tables

- `message_log` split into per-topic `message_log_<topic_id>` tables with
  dense per-topic sequences; `RetentionTTL`/`AllowDropPastCommitted` moved
  onto `topic.Config`; the global table and dead V1 consumer datastore
  package deleted [0241].
- `cursor`/`deliveries` PKs and `binding` gained `topic_id`; `lease` got the
  column without a key change; `cursorFloor` scoped `WHERE topic_id = $1`,
  closing 8a's cross-topic floor bug [0243][0241].
- Topic identity threaded as a `topicID` parameter on every datastore method
  after a mid-phase reversal away from a struct field; constructors split
  into `NewConsumerDatastore`/`NewProducerDatastore` [0244].
- `routing_key`/`bindings` kept above topics with matching logic unchanged;
  within-topic floor sharing across slices left as a deliberate limitation
  with topic-splitting as the escape hatch [0242][0248].
- `deliveries` stays one shared table; a `status` index was considered and
  deliberately not added to preserve HOT updates [0246][0247].
- All 11 labs plus the producer/consumer binaries rewritten to the current
  API; new `topiclab` proves sequence independence, floor isolation, and
  clean `42P01` failure on unregistered topics [0245]; two latent cross-topic
  reclaim/cursor-advance bugs found and fixed.

## 2026-07-08 — 8a: retention — partition-drop plus a low-volume sweep

- `message_log` converted to `PARTITION BY RANGE (id)` in its original
  migration, width via `WorkConsumerConfig.PartitionSize` [0221].
- `WorkConsumer.Janitor` ticker loop runs create-ahead,
  `DropExpiredPartitions`, and batched `SweepExpiredPartitions` each tick;
  drop covers real volume, sweep covers the low-volume gap [0222].
- `RetentionTTL` (zero disables) and `AllowDropPastCommitted` (default false)
  added; drops and sweeps stop at the `MIN(committed)` cursor floor unless
  opted out [0223].
- Bug fixed: `Register` upserted a cursor row for LIFECYCLE groups, whose
  `committed` never advances, permanently pinning the drop floor at 0 — now
  gated to CURSOR-type groups [0225].
- Three new labs (`partitionlab`, `dropfloorlab`, `sweeplab`) drive the real
  datastore methods; the first two swap `message_log` to a lab-scale
  partition width and restore the schema on exit [0224].
- Known limitation filed: one shared log means one lagging group blocks drops
  for every routing key sharing the table [0226].

## 2026-07-03 — Phase 7: routing_key + binding-based routing

- `message_log.routing_key` and `binding(consumer_group, pattern, display)`;
  a group with no bindings still receives everything, so all prior behavior
  is unchanged by default [0201].
- One shared predicate in both paths: `readMessages` filters returned rows
  but the cursor advances the whole claimed range; `FanOut`'s SELECT never
  materializes non-matching `deliveries` rows; evaluated at claim/fan-out
  time, so late-added bindings apply to still-unclaimed messages [0202].
- Patterns are true wildcards translated to anchored POSIX regexes;
  NATS-style depth precision deferred [0203].
- `BindTopic`/`ClearBindings` shipped as admin calls off the `Datastore`
  interface [0204].
- Found and fixed a latent bug: `readMessages` used `SELECT *`, so the cursor
  read path had been silently broken since `routing_key` landed — explicit
  column lists from here on [0205].
- `routinglab` (self-seeding, three groups) proves depth-crossing,
  retroactive bindings, and both paths' filtering; `kind`/`header_match`
  dropped, `FanOut`'s full-table rescan logged as a known separate limitation
  [0206][0207][0208].

## 2026-07-03 — 6.5c: per-message exception handling for failing messages only

- `Commit(group, token, []MessageException, []MessageTerminal)`: frees the
  lease first (`ErrLeaseLost` when stale), then records one `deliveries` row
  per failure — `ready` for retryable, `dead` for terminal — so one bad
  message no longer fails its batch-mates [0181][0182][0186].
- Statuses collapsed to `ready | inflight | dead`, no `done`: success writes
  nothing, and `RecordExceptionSuccess` deletes a resolved row [0181][0188].
- `DrainExceptions` added as its own poll loop; `ClaimExceptions`
  dead-letters expired-inflight rows at `maxAttempts` before claiming
  [0184][0185].
- `AdvanceWaterline` gained a second blocker term — `committed` pins below
  the lowest unresolved `ready`/`inflight` exception; `dead` rows don't block
  [0183].
- Reclaim rewritten as one atomic UPDATE, fixing a `reclaims`-counter reset
  bug; past `MaxRangeReclaims` a range's messages all become fresh-budget
  `ready` rows and the lease is freed for good [0190][0191].
- `exceptionlab`: proves `committed` pins below one recorded exception while
  later ranges commit past it, then jumps to `claimed` on resolution.

## 2026-06-30 — 6.5b: lease-per-range crash recovery for the cursor path

- New `lease(token, consumer_group, low, high, until)` table; `ClaimMessages`
  inserts the lease in the same transaction as the `claimed` advance and
  returns `ClaimedRange{Lease, Messages}` [0161][0163].
- `ClaimMessagesWithCursor` reclaims one expired lease before any fresh
  claim, re-reading the exact `(low, high]` range under a fresh token [0164].
- `CommitRange(group, token)`: token-guarded lease delete replaces
  per-message `MoveCursor`; all waterline motion moved to the `RollWaterline`
  goroutine off the hot path [0166].
- `AdvanceWaterline` split into a one-snapshot SELECT plus a `GREATEST`
  UPDATE after a live multi-worker run exposed the single-statement
  EvalPlanQual bug [0162].
- `reclaimlab`: deterministic crash/reclaim verification — exact-range
  re-read, token rotation, waterline pin, `deliveries` stays empty; cap on
  repeated reclaims deferred as a named handoff [0165].

## 2026-06-26 — 6.5a: claim-from-log happy path

- `cursor` grew `position` into `claimed` + `committed` frontiers;
  `ClaimMessagesWithCursor` advances `claimed` over `(low, high]` in one
  `UPDATE … RETURNING` and N successes collapse into advancing two integers
  on one row [0141].
- The pre-update `claimed` is captured via an `old_values` CTE joined back in
  `FROM`, avoiding PG18's `old` alias so the query runs on PG <18 [0144].
- `MoveCursor` landed the long-forecast monotonic guard
  `committed = $1 WHERE committed < $1`, at the cost of an ambiguous
  `RowsAffected()==0` [0143].
- Per-message commit kept over once-at-`high`, trading batch-level O(1) for a
  tighter crash checkpoint [0142].
- No lease yet: a crash between claim and commit strands
  `(committed, claimed]` — the known hole the range-lease work closes [0145].

## 2026-06-25 — Phase 6: per-row synthesis measured (approximate date; no tag)

- The lifecycle × fan-out synthesis: a `deliveries` row per (group, event)
  gives per-message state under fan-out.
- Its write-amplification wall was measured and became the motivation for the
  claim-from-log refactor that followed.

## 2026-06-23 — Phase 5: fan-out to independent consumer groups over one log

- A `-group` flag plus `just consume group=…` runs multiple groups side by
  side, each an independent `cursor` row over the shared `message_log`;
  `Register` upserts a new group's cursor at position 0 so it replays
  retained history [0121].
- `Process` became a real poll loop (`time.Ticker` on `PollRate`,
  `ctx.Done()` to stop) with `Claim` as the per-batch body [0122]; the loop
  idles one interval before its first claim [0126].
- `just lag` reports `head − position` per group; the lab showed a slowed
  group's lag climbing while another stayed near 0.
- Kept `message_log`/`cursor`/`position` naming over the plan's
  events/consumers vocabulary [0123]; corrected the Phase 4 forecast — the
  monotonic guard belongs to within-group concurrency, not fan-out [0124].
- Failure semantics unchanged: a `consumerFunc` error stops the poll loop;
  retry/DLQ deferred to the `deliveries` work [0125].

## 2026-06-23 — Phase 4: log/queue split lands retention and replay

- Split messaging into append-only `message_log` (`id BIGSERIAL`, `payload`,
  `created_at`) and per-group `cursor` (`consumer_group`, `position`); the
  lifecycle columns and their migrations left the hot path [0101].
- `ClaimMessagesV2` reads the range above `position` in one transaction,
  draining rows before commit to avoid pgx "conn busy" [0107]; `ProcessV2`
  advances the cursor per message [0103].
- A missing `ORDER BY id` in the first claim cut could silently drop offsets
  forever; the fix established that a high-water mark is only correct over an
  ordered claim [0102].
- `MoveCursor` stayed an unguarded `SET position = $1`, safe under one
  consumer per group [0104]; claim-time `FOR UPDATE` serializes claims only
  [0105].
- V1 lease/backoff/`Record*` code kept as reference rather than deleted
  [0106]. Lab confirmed a fresh group at position 0 replays history
  independently.

## 2026-06-20 — Phase 3.5: the commit wall measured

- Only `synchronous_commit` measured, the one lever blind to the upcoming
  topology change; batch-ack measurement skipped since the cursor model is
  its limit case [0081].
- on/off sweep at batch=100: 5.99× at 1 worker shrinking to 1.28× at 64 as
  group commit amortizes concurrent fsyncs under `on`; ~484µs fsync wait at
  conc=1; read by shape with best-of-3/max [0084].
- `off` ruled safe for this queue: a lost commit becomes lease expiry →
  reclaim → rerun, risk already priced by at-least-once plus idempotency
  [0082].
- Crash lab (SIGKILL mid-run, wal_writer_delay widened to 10s): 5000/5000 ids
  processed and `done` under both settings; `off` cost 899 vs 85 duplicate
  reruns — duplicates, never loss [0083].
- `local` left unmeasured (identical to `on` without a replica) [0085]; the
  knob was applied via ALTER DATABASE so pool connections inherit it, then
  reset to `on` [0086].

## 2026-06-20 — Phase 3: competing consumers & batching

- Built the Prefetch/Dispatch pipeline: batch claim into a bounded
  PressureQueue, one goroutine per message under WorkerPoolLimiter,
  backpressure via WaitForRoom [0061]; buffer kept shallow as a lease-safety
  rule [0062]; results recorded per message so a batch is never a failure
  unit [0063].
- Index lab: the ORDER BY id claim degraded 0.057ms → 41.8ms (730×) against
  150k terminal rows; migration 005's
  `idx_claim_active (id) WHERE status IN ('ready','processing')` recovered
  ~0.09ms and ~4.8k → ~19k msgs/s on a deep backlog [0065].
- Ceiling lab settled the model
  throughput = min(supply(batch), ack_capacity(workers)): single-loop supply
  ~290k/s, per-message commit wall ~20-22k msgs/s at 64 workers [0064]; pool
  MaxConns raised past the default 10 to make worker sweeps meaningful
  [0066].
- Group-commit valley observed: 2 workers slower than 1 (~1.1k vs ~1.7k/s)
  until group commit amortizes from 4 workers up.
- Variance proof: 3 slow messages at the head of 6000 fast never stalled fast
  throughput at 8 workers (wall 6.1s vs 60.7s at concurrency=1).
- Future scaling levers fixed in priority order [0067].

## 2026-06-15 — Phase 2: per-message lifecycle

- Migration `003_lifecycle` adds `status`, `attempts`, `can_run_after`,
  `locked_at`, `last_error`; claiming flips `ready` → `processing` instead of
  deleting [0041].
- Claim is one `UPDATE ... RETURNING` with `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` in the
  subquery; crashed-worker reclamation is an `OR` branch on the same
  predicate — no reaper [0041][0044].
- Retries back off via `can_run_after`; exhausted messages land in `dead`,
  and the DLQ is the query `WHERE status='dead'` [0042][0043].
- Stuck window set to work timeout + 5s so live workers are never reclaimed
  [0045].
- Consumer becomes sole owner of `BatchLimit`/`MaxAttempts`/`WorkTimeout`,
  killing the silent-no-op duplicated datastore config [0046].
- Double-delivery induced deliberately (sleep past the lease); at-least-once
  with idempotent `consumerFunc` adopted as the contract [0047].

## 2026-06-14 — Phase 1.5: transactional enqueue

- `AppendMessage` opens the transaction, runs the caller's
  `ProducerFunc(ctx, tx)` on it, then INSERTs into `message_log` and
  commits — both writes land or neither [0021][0022].
- `ProducerFunc` takes a concrete `pgx.Tx`, with a marked extraction point if
  a second backend appears [0023].
- Migration `002_users` adds the toy business table for the labs.
- Labs pass: forced rollback leaves neither row; commit yields both plus a
  claimable job; a consumer never sees an uncommitted producer's message
  [0021].

## 2026-06-13 — Phase 1: durable atom — append plus atomic claim

- Claim → process → delete → commit as one transaction; the claim is
  `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` [0001][0002].
- Crash recovery is transaction rollback — kill-mid-process and crash-after
  labs pass with zero recovery code [0002].
- Two-workers-no-collisions and blocking-vs-skipping contrast labs pass
  [0001].
- Batch limit pinned to 1 to avoid batch poisoning [0004].
- Graceful shutdown finishes the in-flight batch via `context.WithoutCancel`
  + timeout; a graceful stop and a crash look identical to the queue [0005].
- Table name stays `message_log`; the `jobs` rename is deferred to the
  log/queue split [0006].
