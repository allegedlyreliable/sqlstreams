# 0515 — Group tunables live in worker metadata as {default, override}; users tune through domain nouns

**Context.** Consumer tuning (tick rate etc.) lived only in ConsumerConfig --
per-binary, no live tuning. Worker rows already carry metadata JSONB parsed at
claim time (janitor/manager/cronscheduler poll_rate), but altering it meant
raw SQL, and "worker" is an internal concept most users should never meet.
Research: RabbitMQ built policies because immutable declaration args were
operationally miserable; K8s server-side apply settled on field ownership so
code and operators never fight over one value; Kafka's describe shows every
effective value with its source.

**Decision.**
- Every tunable worker-metadata key is nested: `{"default": v, "override": v}`.
  Effective = override, else default. Consumer Register writes `default`
  unconditionally (code is truth for its layer); alter verbs write `override`,
  which survives deploys until explicitly cleared. No conflict semantics
  needed -- the layers are different facts.
- Group-tunable ConsumerConfig fields (each consumer kind gets its own
  metadata struct): ClaimPollRate, MaxRangeReclaims, ExceptionInitialBackoff,
  Message defaults, ConcurrencyOverride. Message overrides clamp into the
  code-owned MessageMin/MessageMax bounds via the existing machinery, warn on
  clamp. Everything else (BatchLimit, QueueSize, MessageConcurrency, margins,
  TTLs, shutdown, Retry, Logger) stays instance-local in ConsumerConfig.
- Surface tiering:
  - App devs: ConsumerConfig in code -> default layer. Never see workers.
  - Operators: admin.AlterGroup + `vulkan group alter` (override layer,
    explicit --clear) and `vulkan group get` showing effective value + source.
  - Powerusers: `vulkan worker` tree -- list / get / alter / suspend / resume
    -- addressing any worker row (janitor, manager, cronscheduler, alert
    consumers) by owner + name; alter writes the same override layer and
    target_instances. No worker register/destroy: rows are declared and
    cascade-deleted by their owning domains.
- Existing worker kinds' flat metadata ({"poll_rate": ns}) reshapes to the
  nested form -- one scheme everywhere.
- Changes take effect at the next claim life, like every worker metadata read.

**Consequences.** Live per-group tuning without redeploys; operator overrides
survive deploys instead of silently reverting (the K8s HPA-vs-CI/CD failure).
Drift between code and override is visible in group get, never fought over.
Rejected: register-vs-alter mismatch errors (RabbitMQ's escape from exactly
that), last-writer-wins (the silent-revert outage pattern).

Superseded by [0518]: vulkan's users deploy one team's few apps against one
database, so the operator and the developer are the same person and the
override layer has no second writer to protect. The metadata home and the
per-kind structs stand; the override layer and the alter verbs are deleted.
