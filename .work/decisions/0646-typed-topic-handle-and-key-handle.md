# 0646 — the topic handle carries the message type; a message key is a handle under it

Superseded in part by [0653].

Amends [0619] and [0625].

**Context.** `TopicHandle.CompactionHead[T]`, `AlertHandle.Get`, and
`MeasurementHandle.Get` all read the head under a message key with no
general form, and the type argument sat on every reading verb and every
Register. Go 1.27 generic methods can return a generic type, so it can move up.

**Decision.** `client.Topic[Message Versioned](name) *TopicHandle[Message]`,
the type argument required on every topic handle. Everything under it
inherits the type and takes none of its own: `Group(name).Register(ctx,
cfg, handler)` (was `client.Consumer`; `ConsumerHandle` is deleted),
`Producer().Register(ctx, cfg)` (was `client.Producer`),
`CompactionHeads(ctx)` (the controller's `ListHeads`, which three
built-in readers need whole, so no limit and no second query), and
`Key(messageKey) *KeyHandle[Message]` with `MessageKey()`,
`CompactionHead(ctx)`, and `Messages(ctx, limit)`. Admin verbs ignore
the type, so a topic holding two schema versions is two handles on the
same rows. The key is the resource, not a `Compaction()` sub-handle: the
key is a message property with two readers [0612], and lease facts land
on the same handle later.

`CompactionHead` returns `compaction.ErrCompactionHeadNotFound`
(VK0066, Permanent, new `pkg/compaction/errors.go`); only `Get` verbs
are comma-ok. `AlertHandle.Get` and `MeasurementHandle.Get` become
one-liners over `Topic[Alert](alert.TopicName).Key(k)` and map the
error back to `(nil, nil)`.

`common.RawPayload []byte` serves callers with no message type in
scope, the CLI and admin-only scripts: `SchemaVersion()` returns 0 and
the `json.RawMessage` marshal pair keeps the stored bytes verbatim.
Producer, group, and scheduler Register refuse a version below 1 with
a plain error. The CLI gains `topic key get <topic> <key>` and `topic
key messages <topic> <key> --limit`. Schedules stay system-rooted on
`client.Scheduler(name)`: only Register knows a payload type, inferred
from the payload argument. The handle's type parameter is `Message`;
the three methods returning the `Message[Payload]` alias spell their
receiver `[Payload]`, as `ProducerInstance.GetCompactionHeadInTx` does.

**Consequences.** Amends [0619]'s clause "a struct is generic only when
it holds Message-typed state": a handle is generic to carry the type
downward, holding none; controllers and datastores stay plain structs
with `[Message]` on the method. Compile-time breaking on the client,
JSON unchanged. The ROADMAP item "Register returns what you run" folds
into this build.

Rejected: `Topic().Compaction()` as a mechanism sub-handle (the key
stays positional, `Messages` is not a compaction fact, lease state would
need a sibling); `vulkan.Of[T](handle)` (two handle types per level); a
topic-rooted schedule (a redundant topic on seven of eight verbs and on
every `vulkan schedule` command); an untyped `Topic(name)` beside the
typed one (Go cannot overload). Deferred to ROADMAP Later beside the
upcaster: a mismatched-version head read decodes silently.
